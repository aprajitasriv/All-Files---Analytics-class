Aeschylus, The Libation Bearers Death is but crossing the world, as friends do the seas; they live in one another still. For they must needs be present, that love and live in that which is omnipresent. In this divine glass they see face to face; and their converse is free, as well as pure. This is the comfort of friends, that though they may be said to die, yet their friendship and society are, in the best sense, ever present, because immortal.  William Penn, More Fruits of Solitude  \\x0c      Harry Potter AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS     \\x0c   \\x0cC H A P T E R  O N E THE DARK LORD  ASCENDING  T he two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other’s chests; then, recognizing each other, they  stowed  their  wands  beneath  their  cloaks  and  started  walking briskly in the same direction. “News?” asked the taller of the two. “The best,” replied Severus Snape. The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on  the  right  by  a  high,  neatly  manicured  hedge.  The  men’s  long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched. “Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt features slid-ing in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. “It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?” Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a (cid:145) 1 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ONE wide  driveway  that  led  off  the  lane.  The  high  hedge  curved  with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron  gates  barring  the  men’s  way.  Neither  of  them  broke step: In silence both raised  their left  arms  in  a  kind  of  salute  and passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke. The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his companion’s head, but the source of the noise proved  to  be  nothing  more  than  a  pure-white  peacock,  strutting majestically along the top of the hedge. “He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks . . .” Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort. A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a foun-tain  was  playing.  Gravel  crackled  beneath  their  feet  as  Snape  and Yaxley  sped  toward  the  front  door,  which  swung  inward  at  their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it. The  hallway  was  large,  dimly  lit,  and  sumptuously  decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as  they  strode  past.  The  two  men  halted  at  a  heavy  wooden  door leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle. The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a  handsome  marble  mantelpiece  surmounted  by  a  gilded  mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their (cid:145) 2 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DARK  LORD ASCENDING eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently unconscious hu-man figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so. “Yaxley. Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. “You are very nearly late.” The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through the  gloom,  hairless,  snakelike,  with  slits  for  nostrils  and  gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow. “Severus,  here,”  said  Voldemort,  indicating  the  seat  on  his  im-mediate right. “Yaxley — beside Dolohov.” The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first. “So?” “My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Pot-ter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.” The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort. “Saturday . . . at nightfall,” repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fas-tened upon Snape’s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would (cid:145) 3 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ONE be  scorched  by  the  ferocity  of  the  gaze.  Snape,  however,  looked calmly back into Voldemort’s face and, after a moment or two, Vol-demort’s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile. “Good. Very good. And this information comes —” “— from the source we discussed,” said Snape. “My Lord.” Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Volde-mort and Snape. All faces turned to him. “My Lord, I have heard differently.” Yaxley  waited,  but  Voldemort  did  not  speak,  so  he  went  on, “Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.” Snape was smiling. “My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.” “I  assure  you,  my  Lord,  Dawlish  seemed  quite  certain,”  said Yaxley. “If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said Snape. “I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the  protection  of  Harry  Potter.  The  Order  believes  that  we  have infiltrated the Ministry.” “The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a squat man sit-ting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table. Voldemort  did  not  laugh.  His  gaze  had  wandered  upward  to the  body  revolving  slowly  overhead,  and  he  seemed  to  be  lost  in thought.  (cid:145) 4 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DARK  LORD ASCENDING “My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy —” Voldemort  held  up  a  large  white hand,  and  Yaxley  subsided  at once, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape. “Where are they going to hide the boy next?” “At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “The place, accord-ing  to  the  source,  has  been  given  every  protection  that  the  Order and  Ministry  together  could  provide.  I  think  that  there  is  little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.” “Well,  Yaxley?”  Voldemort  called  down  the  table,  the  firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes. “Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?” Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders. “My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have — with dif-ficulty,  and  after  great  effort  —  suceeded  in  placing  an  Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.” Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neigh-bor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back. “It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour  must  be  surrounded  by  our  people  before  I  act.  One failed attempt on the Minister’s life will set me back a long way.” “Yes — my Lord, that is true — but you know, as Head of the Department  of  Magical  Law  Enforcement,  Thicknesse  has  regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads   (cid:145) 5 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ONE of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that  we  have  such  a  high-ranking  official  under  our  control,  to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.” “As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted  the  rest,”  said  Voldemort.  “At  any  rate,  it  remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.” “We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed determined  to  receive  some  portion  of  approval.  “We  now  have several  people  planted  within  the  Department  of  Magical  Trans-port. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.” “He will not do either,” said Snape. “The Order is eschewing any form  of  transport  that  is  controlled  or  regulated  by  the  Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.” “All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move in the open. Easier to take, by far.” Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, “I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many  mistakes  where  Harry  Potter  is  concerned.  Some  of  them have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.” The  company  around  the  table  watched  Voldemort  apprehen-sively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort, how-ever, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him. (cid:145) 6 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DARK  LORD ASCENDING “I  have  been  careless,  and  so  have  been  thwarted  by  luck  and chance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know bet-ter now. I understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.” At  these  words,  seemingly  in  response  to  them,  a  sudden  wail sounded,  a  terrible,  drawn-out  cry  of  misery  and  pain.  Many  of those  at  the  table  looked  downward,  startled,  for  the  sound  had seemed to issue from below their feet. “Wormtail,”  said  Voldemort,  with  no  change  in  his  quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above, “have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?” “Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver. “As  I  was  saying,”  continued  Voldemort,  looking  again  at  the tense faces of his followers, “I understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.” The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms. “No volunteers?” said Voldemort. “Let’s see . . . Lucius, I see no reason for you to have a wand anymore.” Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. “My Lord?” (cid:145) 7 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ONE “Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.” “I . . .” Malfoy  glanced  sideways  at  his  wife.  She  was  staring  straight ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely. “What is it?” “Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy. “And the core?” “Dragon — dragon heartstring.” “Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand and com-pared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Volde-mort’s wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously. “Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?” Some of the throng sniggered. “I  have  given  you  your  liberty,  Lucius,  is  that  not  enough  for you?  But  I  have  noticed  that  you  and  your  family  seem  less  than happy of late. . . . What is it about my presence in your home that displeases you, Lucius?” “Nothing — nothing, my Lord!” “Such lies, Lucius . . .” The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shud-der  as  the  hissing  grew  louder;  something  heavy  could  be  heard sliding across the floor beneath the table. (cid:145) 8 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DARK  LORD ASCENDING The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It  rose,  seemingly  endlessly,  and  came  to  rest  across  Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy. “Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my re-turn, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?” “Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it — we do.” To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact. “My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our family’s house. There can be no higher pleasure.” She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness. “No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to  one  side  as  he  considered  Bellatrix.  “That  means  a  great  deal, Bellatrix, from you.” Her  face  flooded  with  color;  her  eyes  welled  with  tears  of delight. “My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!” “No  higher  pleasure  .  .  .  even  compared  with  the  happy  event that, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?” (cid:145) 9 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ONE She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused. “I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.” “I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa.  She  has  just  married  the  werewolf,  Remus  Lupin.  You must be so proud.” There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many  leaned  forward  to  exchange  gleeful  looks;  a  few  thumped the table with their fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys’ hu-miliation.  Bellatrix’s  face,  so  recently  flushed  with  happiness,  had turned an ugly, blotchy red. “She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring of mirth. “We — Narcissa and I — have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.” “What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “Will you babysit the cubs?” The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother’s eye.  She  shook  her  head  almost  imperceptibly,  then  resumed  her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall. “Enough,” said  Voldemort, stroking the  angry snake. “Enough.” And the laughter died at once. “Many  of  our  oldest  family  trees  become  a  little  diseased  over time,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring.   (cid:145) 10 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DARK  LORD ASCENDING “You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.” “Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again. “At the first chance!” “You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your family, so in the world . . . we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain. . . .” Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick.  The  figure  came  to  life  with  a  groan  and  began  to  struggle against invisible bonds. “Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Voldemort. Snape raised his eyes to the upside-down face. All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had been given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face the fire-light,  the  woman  said  in  a  cracked  and  terrified  voice,  “Severus! Help me!” “Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again. “And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the snake’s snout with his wand-free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he seemed unable to look at her anymore. “But you would not have taken her classes,” said Voldemort. “For those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witch-craft and Wizardry.” There  were  small  noises  of  comprehension  around  the  table.  A broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled. “Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and   (cid:145) 11 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ONE wizards all about Muggles . . . how they are not so different from us . . .” One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage re-volved to face Snape again. “Severus . . . please . . . please . . .” “Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy’s wand, and  Charity  fell  silent  as  if  gagged.  “Not  content  with  corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowl-edge and magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance. . . . She would have us all mate with Muggles . . . or, no doubt, werewolves. . . .” Nobody laughed this time: There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from him again. “Avada Kedavra.” The  flash  of  green  light  illuminated  every  corner  of  the  room. Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor. “Dinner,  Nagini,”  said  Voldemort  softly,  and  the  great  snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood. (cid:145) 12 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W O IN MEMORIAM     H arry  was  bleeding.  Clutching  his  right  hand  in  his  left and  swearing  under  his  breath,  he  shouldered  open  his bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china: He had trod-den on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door. “What the — ?” He looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley’s idea of a clever booby trap.  Keeping  his  bleeding  hand  elevated,  Harry  scraped  the  frag-ments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap. It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic . . . but he had to ad-mit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came (cid:145) 13 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWO to think of it — particularly in light of his immediate plans — this seemed  a  serious  flaw  in  his  magical  education.  Making  a  mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him. Harry  had  spent  the  morning  completely  emptying  his  school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom — old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previ-ously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood. He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retriev-ing  an  old  badge  that  flickered  feebly  between  SUPPORT  CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneak-oscope,  and  a  gold  locket  inside  which  a  note  signed  R.A.B.  had been  hidden,  he  finally  discovered  the  sharp  edge  that  had  done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long frag-ment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather’s last gift except  powdered  glass,  which  clung  to  the  deepest  layer  of  debris like glittering grit. Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning’s (cid:145) 14 (cid:145) \\x0cIN  MEMORIAM Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the  sudden  upsurge  of  bitter  memories,  the  stabs  of  regret  and  of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by at-tacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk. It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the use-less items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, proba-bly, as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing,  Invisibility  Cloak,  potion-making  kit,  certain  books,  the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the Marauder’s Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable — in all usual senses it was worthless — but because of what it had cost to attain it. This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer. He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the news-papers, throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one. The owl was asleep, or else faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment. As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly  after  he  had  returned  to  Privet  Drive  for  the  summer;  he (cid:145) 15 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWO remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for.  ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED by Elphias Doge I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven,  on  our  first  day  at  Hogwarts. Our  mutual  attraction  was  undoubt-edly  due  to  the  fact  that  we  both  felt ourselves  to  be  outsiders.  I  had  con-tracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and  while  I  was  no  longer  contagious,  my  pock-marked visage and greenish hue did not encour-age many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety.  Scarcely  a  year  previously,  his  father, Percival,  had  been  convicted  of  a  savage  and  well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles. Albus  never  attempted  to  deny  that  his  father (who  was  to  die  in  Azkaban)  had  committed  this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make him  do  so.  Some,  indeed,  were  disposed  to  praise his father’s action and assumed that Albus too was a Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mis-(cid:145) 16 (cid:145) \\x0cIN  MEMORIAM taken: As anybody who knew Albus would attest, he never  revealed  the  remotest  anti-Muggle  tendency. Indeed,  his  determined  support  for  Muggle  rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years. In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be his friends ben-efited from his example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching. He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas  Flamel,  the  celebrated  alchemist;  Bathilda Bagshot,  the  noted  historian;  and  Adalbert  Waf-fling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found  their  way  into  learned  publications  such  as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore’s future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial ambitions. Three  years  after  we  had  started  at  Hogwarts, (cid:145) 17 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWO Albus’s brother, Aberforth,  arrived  at  school.  They were  not  alike;  Aberforth  was  never  bookish  and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by duel-ing rather than through reasoned discussion. How-ever, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the  brothers  were  not  friends.  They  rubbed  along as comfortably as two such different boys could do. In  fairness  to  Aberforth,  it  must  be  admitted  that living in Albus’s shadow cannot have been an alto-gether  comfortable  experience.  Being  continually outshone  was  an  occupational  hazard  of  being  his friend  and  cannot  have  been  any  more  pleasurable as a brother. When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then-traditional tour of the world together, visiting  and  observing  foreign  wizards,  before  pur-suing our separate careers. However, tragedy inter-vened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus’s mother, Kendra,  died,  leaving  Albus  the  head,  and  sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my depar-ture  long  enough  to  pay  my  respects  at  Kendra’s funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me. That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insen-sitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow es-capes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments (cid:145) 18 (cid:145) \\x0cIN  MEMORIAM of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustrat-ingly  dull  for  such  a  brilliant  wizard.  Immersed  in my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward the end of my year’s travels, that yet another tragedy  had  struck  the  Dumbledores:  the  death  of his sister, Ariana. Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of her broth-ers. All those closest to Albus — and I count my-self one of that lucky number — agree that Ariana’s death, and Albus’s feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore. I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person’s suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less light-hearted.  To  add  to  his  misery,  the  loss  of  Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and  Aberforth,  but  to  an  estrangement.  (In  time this would lift — in later years they reestablished, if  not  a  close  relationship,  then  certainly  a  cordial one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to mention them. Other quills will describe the triumphs of the fol-lowing years. Dumbledore’s innumerable contribu-tions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including (cid:145) 19 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWO his  discovery  of  the  twelve  uses  of  dragon’s  blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they  felt  as  they  watched  these  two  extraordinary wizards  do  battle.  Dumbledore’s  triumph,  and  its consequences for the Wizarding world, are consid-ered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could  find  something  to  value  in  anyone,  however apparently  insignificant  or  wretched,  and  I  believe that his early losses endowed him with great human-ity  and  sympathy.  I  shall  miss  his  friendship  more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world’s. That he was the most inspir-ing and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing  to  stretch  out  a  hand  to  a  small  boy  with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.  Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture ac-companying the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar,   (cid:145) 20 (cid:145) \\x0cIN  MEMORIAM kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spec-tacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. He  had  never  thought  to  ask  Dumbledore  about  his  past.  No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, Harry’s  past,  Harry’s  future,  Harry’s  plans  .  .  .  and  it  seemed  to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so  uncertain,  that  he  had  missed  irreplaceable  opportunities  when he had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the  only  personal  question  he  had  ever  asked  his  headmaster  was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered honestly: “What do you see when you look in the mirror?” “I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” After several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts. Then he   (cid:145) 21 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWO threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left out of place were today’s Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror. Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today’s Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing  about  Voldemort.  Harry  was  sure  that  the  Ministry  was leaning  on  the  Prophet  to  suppress  news  about  Voldemort.  It  was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed. Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried:  DUMBLEDORE — THE TRUTH AT LAST? Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation. Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the life-long feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave. WHY was the man tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a mere head-master?  WHAT  was  the  real  purpose  of  the  secret organization  known  as  the  Order  of  the  Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end? The  answers  to  these  and  many  more  questions are  explored  in  the  explosive  new  biography,  The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, (cid:145) 22 (cid:145) \\x0cIN  MEMORIAM exclusively  interviewed  by  Betty  Braithwaite,  page 13, inside.  Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating im-age, Harry read on.  In  person,  Rita  Skeeter  is  much  warmer  and softer  than  her  famously  ferocious  quill-portraits might  suggest.  Greeting  me  in  the  hallway  of  her cozy  home,  she  leads  me  straight  into  the  kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip. “Well,  of  course,  Dumbledore  is  a  biographer’s dream,” says Skeeter. “Such a long, full life. I’m sure my book will be the first of very, very many.” Skeeter  was  certainly  quick  off  the  mark.  Her nine-hundred-page book was completed a mere four weeks after Dumbledore’s mysterious death in June. I ask her how she managed this superfast feat. “Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as I  have,  working  to  a  deadline  is  second  nature.  I knew  that  the  Wizarding  world  was  clamoring  for the  full  story  and  I  wanted  to  be  the  first  to  meet that need.” I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks (cid:145) 23 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWO of  Elphias  Doge,  Special  Advisor  to  the  Wizen-gamot  and  longstanding  friend  of  Albus  Dumble-dore’s, that “Skeeter’s book contains less fact than a Chocolate Frog card.” Skeeter throws back her head and laughs. “Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights, bless him. Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout.” And yet Elphias Doge’s accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. Does Skeeter re-ally feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain  a  full  picture  of  Dumbledore’s  long  and  ex-traordinary life? “Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rapping me affec-tionately across the knuckles, “you know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word ‘no,’ and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People were queuing  to  dish  the  dirt  on  Dumbledore  anyway. Not  everyone  thought  he  was  so  wonderful,  you know — he trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I’ve had access to a source most journal-ists would swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to Dum-bledore  during  the  most  turbulent  and  disturbing phase of his youth.” (cid:145) 24 (cid:145) \\x0cIN  MEMORIAM The advance publicity for Skeeter’s biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for  those  who  believe  Dumbledore  to  have  led  a blameless  life.  What  were  the  biggest  surprises  she uncovered, I ask? “Now, come off it, Betty, I’m not giving away all the  highlights  before  anybody’s  bought  the  book!” laughs  Skeeter.  “But  I  can  promise  that  anybody who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! Let’s just say that nobody hearing  him  rage  against  You-Know-Who  would have  dreamed  that  he  dabbled  in  the  Dark  Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn’t ex-actly broad-minded when he was younger! Yes, Al-bus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.” I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the Wizen-gamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago. “Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,” laughs  Skeeter.  “No,  no,  I’m  talking  about  much worse  than  a  brother  with  a  fondness  for  fiddling about  with  goats,  worse  even  than  the  Muggle-maiming father — Dumbledore couldn’t keep either of  them  quiet  anyway,  they  were  both  charged  by the Wizengamot. No, it’s the mother and the sister (cid:145) 25 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWO that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness — but, as I say, you’ll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it’s no wonder Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken.” Family  skeletons  notwithstanding,  does  Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to Dumbledore’s many magical discoveries? “He had brains,” she concedes, “although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in chapter  sixteen,  Ivor  Dillonsby  claims  he  had  al-ready discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when Dumbledore ‘borrowed’ his papers.” But  the  importance  of  some  of  Dumbledore’s achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald? “Oh, now, I’m glad you mentioned Grindelwald,” says Skeeter with a tantalizing smile. “I’m afraid those who  go  dewy-eyed  over  Dumbledore’s  spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell — or perhaps  a  Dungbomb.  Very  dirty  business  indeed. All I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend. After they’ve read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grin-delwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!” Skeeter  refuses  to  give  any  more  away  on  this intriguing  subject,  so  we  turn  instead  to  the  rela-(cid:145) 26 (cid:145) \\x0cIN  MEMORIAM tionship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other. “Oh yes,” says Skeeter, nodding briskly, “I devote an  entire  chapter  to  the  whole  Potter-Dumbledore relationship.  It’s  been  called  unhealthy,  even  sinis-ter.  Again,  your  readers  will  have  to  buy  my  book for  the  whole  story,  but  there  is  no  question  that Dumbledore  took  an  unnatural  interest  in  Potter from  the  word  go.  Whether  that  was  really  in  the boy’s  best  interests  —  well,  we’ll  see.  It’s  certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.” I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so famously interviewed last year: a  breakthrough  piece  in  which  Potter  spoke  exclu-sively  of  his  conviction  that  You-Know-Who  had returned. “Oh,  yes,  we’ve  developed  a  close  bond,”  says Skeeter.  “Poor  Potter  has  few  real  friends,  and  we met at one of the most testing moments of his life —  the  Triwizard  Tournament.  I  am  probably  one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.” Which  leads  us  neatly  to  the  many  rumors  still circulating  about  Dumbledore’s  final  hours.  Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumble-dore died? “Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle (cid:145) 27 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWO saw  Potter  running  away  from  the  scene  moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Pot-ter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against  whom  he  has  a  notorious  grudge.  Is  every-thing  as  it  seems?  That  is  for  the  Wizarding  com-munity to decide — once they’ve read my book.” On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller. Dumbledore’s legions of admirers, mean-while,  may  well  be  trembling  at  what  is  soon  to emerge about their hero.  Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflow-ing bin. He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty draw-ers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely  conscious  of  what  he  was  doing,  as  random  phrases  from Rita’s article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship . . . It’s been called unhealthy, even sinister. . . . He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth . . . I’ve had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for . . . “Lies!”  Harry  bellowed,  and  through  the  window  he  saw  the next-door  neighbor,  who  had  paused  to  restart  his  lawn  mower, look up nervously. Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers, (cid:145) 28 (cid:145) \\x0cIN  MEMORIAM thinking,  thinking  of  Dumbledore  and  the  lies  with  which  Rita Skeeter was defaming him. . . . A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach  color  of  Aunt  Petunia’s  choosing:  There  was  nothing  blue there for the mirror to reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him. He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce him again. (cid:145) 29 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T H R E E THE DURSLEYS  DEPARTING  T he  sound  of  the  front  door  slamming  echoed  up  the  stairs and a voice yelled, “Oi! You!” Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom his uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. He was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for a split second, he had thought he saw Dumbledore’s eye. It was not until his uncle bellowed, “BOY!” that Harry got slowly to his feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him. “You took your time!” roared Vernon Dursley when Harry ap-peared at the top of the stairs. “Get down here, I want a word!” Harry  strolled  downstairs,  his  hands  deep  in  his  jeans  pockets. When he reached the living room he found all three Dursleys. They were  dressed  for  traveling:  Uncle  Vernon  in  a  fawn  zip-up  jacket, Aunt  Petunia  in  a  neat  salmon-colored  coat,  and  Dudley,  Harry’s large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket. (cid:145) 30 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DURSLEYS DEPARTING “Yes?” asked Harry. “Sit  down!”  said  Uncle  Vernon.  Harry  raised  his  eyebrows. “Please!” added Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat. Harry  sat.  He  thought  he  knew  what  was  coming.  His  uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following his  movements  with  anxious  expressions.  Finally,  his  large  purple face crumpled with concentration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke. “I’ve changed my mind,” he said. “What a surprise,” said Harry. “Don’t  you  take  that  tone  —”  began  Aunt  Petunia  in  a  shrill voice, but Vernon Dursley waved her down. “It’s all a lot of claptrap,” said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy little eyes. “I’ve decided I don’t believe a word of it. We’re staying put, we’re not going anywhere.” Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry’s favorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dud-ley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had been  unpacked,  had  attempted  to  hoist  it  back  into  the  boot  and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing. “According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pac-ing up and down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From — from —” “Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry. “Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt (cid:145) 31 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THREE in front of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it’s a plot to get the house.” “The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?” “This  house!”  shrieked  Uncle  Vernon,  the  vein  in  his  forehead starting to pulse. “Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of  hocus-pocus  and  before  we  know  it  the  deeds  will  be  in  your name and —” “Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house? Are you actually as stupid as you look?” “Don’t you dare — !” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the danger he had spotted. “Just  in  case  you’ve  forgotten,”  said  Harry,  “I’ve  already  got  a house, my godfather left me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?” There  was  silence.  Harry  thought  he  had  rather  impressed  his uncle with this argument. “You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that this Lord Thing —” “— Voldemort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been through this about a hundred times already. This isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Dum-bledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley —” Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unan-nounced visit, a few days into Harry’s summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the   (cid:145) 32 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DURSLEYS DEPARTING Dursleys.  Harry  had  to  admit,  however,  that  as  Mr.  Weasley  had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon. “—  Kingsley  and  Mr.  Weasley  explained  it  all  as  well,”  Harry pressed on remorselessly. “Once I’m seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I’d come and try to rescue you.” Uncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Ver-non walked on and Harry resumed, “You’ve got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help. You’re being offered serious protection, the best there is.” Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down. Outside  the  sun  hung  low  over  the  privet  hedges.  The  next-door neighbor’s lawn mower stalled again. “I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Durs-ley abruptly. “There is,” said Harry, surprised. “Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government protection!” Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted. “You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry replied. “We think the Ministry has been infiltrated.”  (cid:145) 33 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THREE Uncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back, breathing so heav-ily that his great black mustache rippled, his face still purple with concentration. “All  right,”  he  said,  stopping  in  front  of  Harry  yet  again.  “All right, let’s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection. I still don’t see why we can’t have that Kingsley bloke.” Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This ques-tion had also been addressed half a dozen times. “As  I’ve  told  you,”  he  said  through  gritted  teeth,  “Kingsley  is protecting the Mug — I mean, your Prime Minister.” “Exactly  —  he’s  the  best!”  said  Uncle  Vernon,  pointing  at  the blank television screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reas-suring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with his earring in. “Well,  he’s  taken,”  said  Harry.  “But  Hestia  Jones  and  Dedalus Diggle are more than up to the job —” “If we’d even seen CVs . . .” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost patience. Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now point-ing at the TV set himself. “These accidents aren’t accidents — the crashes and explosions and  derailments  and  whatever  else  has  happened  since  we  last watched the news. People are disappearing and dying and he’s be-hind it — Voldemort. I’ve told you this over and over again, he kills   (cid:145) 34 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DURSLEYS DEPARTING Muggles for fun. Even the fogs — they’re caused by dementors, and if you can’t remember what they are, ask your son!” Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his par-ents’ and Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, “There are . . . more of them?” “More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you mean? Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed off fear and despair —” “All  right,  all  right,”  blustered  Vernon  Dursley.  “You’ve  made your point —” “I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all of them — Death Eaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi — which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard — will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you’ll agree you need help.” There  was  a  brief  silence  in  which  the  distant  echo  of  Hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, “But what about my work? What about Dudley’s school? I don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards —” “Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry. “They will torture and kill you like they did my parents!” “Dad,” said Dudley in a loud voice, “Dad — I’m going with these Order people.” “Dudley,” said Harry, “for the first time in your life, you’re talk-ing sense.”  He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened  (cid:145) 35 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THREE enough  to  accept  the  Order’s  help,  his  parents  would  accompany him: There could be no question of being separated from their Did-dykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece. “They’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said, and when none of the Dursleys replied, he left the room. The prospect of part-ing — probably forever — from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years’ solid dislike? Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack, then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage. They fell with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them. “We’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry told her. “And then you’ll be able to fly again.” The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on their own. “Harry  Potter!”  squeaked  an  excited  voice,  the  moment  Harry had opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow. “An honor, as ever!” “Thanks,  Dedalus,”  said  Harry,  bestowing  a  small  and  em-barrassed  smile  upon  the  dark-haired  Hestia.  “It’s  really  good  of you to do this. . . . They’re through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin. . . .” “Good  day  to  you,  Harry  Potter’s  relatives!”  said  Dedalus  hap-pily, striding into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change of mind. Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard. (cid:145) 36 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DURSLEYS DEPARTING “I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has  told  you,  is  a  simple  one,”  said  Dedalus,  pulling  an  immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. “We shall be leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic in your house — Harry being still underage, it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him — we shall be driving, say, ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you.  You  know  how  to  drive,  I  take  it?”  he  asked  Uncle  Vernon politely. “Know how to — ? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “Very clever of you, sir, very clever, I personally would be ut-terly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus. He was clearly under the impression that he was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word Dedalus spoke. “Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling  indignantly,  but  fortunately  neither  Dedalus  nor  Hestia seemed to hear him. “You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for your guard. There has been a little change in the arrangements —” “What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought Mad-Eye was going to come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition?” “Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely. “Mad-Eye will explain.” The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, “Hurry up!” Harry looked all around the room before realizing that the voice had issued from Dedalus’s pocket watch. “Quite  right,  we’re  operating  to  a  very  tight  schedule,”  said (cid:145) 37 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THREE Dedalus, nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waist-coat.  “We  are  attempting  to  time  your  departure  from  the  house with your family’s Disapparition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at the  moment  you  all  head  for  safety.”  He  turned  to  the  Dursleys. “Well, are we all packed and ready to go?” None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring, ap-palled, at the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket. “Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured Hestia. She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, pos-sibly tearful farewells. “There’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly, “Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.” He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome. “Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether. Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp. “Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon. He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mum-bled, “I don’t understand.” “What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia, look-ing up at her son. Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry. “Why isn’t he coming with us?”  (cid:145) 38 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DURSLEYS DEPARTING Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, star-ing at Dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina. “What?” said Uncle Vernon loudly. “Why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley. “Well, he — he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and adding, “You don’t want to, do you?” “Not in the slightest,” said Harry. “There  you  are,”  Uncle  Vernon  told  Dudley.  “Now  come  on, He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Pe-tunia stopped too. “What  now?”  barked  Uncle  Vernon,  reappearing  in  the we’re off.” doorway. It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. After several moments of apparently painful in-ternal struggle he said, “But where’s he going to go?” Aunt  Petunia  and  Uncle  Vernon  looked  at  each  other.  It  was clear  that  Dudley  was  frightening  them.  Hestia  Jones  broke  the silence. “But  .  .  .  surely  you  know  where  your  nephew  is  going?”  she asked, looking bewildered. “Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley. “He’s off with some of your lot, isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard the man, we’re in a hurry.” Again,  Vernon  Dursley  marched  as  far  as  the  front  door,  but Dudley did not follow.  (cid:145) 39 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THREE “Off with some of our lot?” Hestia  looked  outraged.  Harry  had  met  this  attitude  before: Witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closest living relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter. “It’s fine,” Harry assured her. “It doesn’t matter, honestly.” “Doesn’t  matter?”  repeated  Hestia,  her  voice  rising  ominously. “Don’t these people realize what you’ve been through? What danger you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-Voldemort movement?” “Er — no, they don’t,” said Harry. “They think I’m a waste of space, actually, but I’m used to —” “I don’t think you’re a waste of space.” If  Harry  had  not  seen  Dudley’s  lips  move,  he  might  not  have believed it. As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting  that  it  must  have  been  his  cousin  who  had  spoken;  for one  thing,  Dudley  had  turned  red.  Harry  was  embarrassed  and astonished himself. “Well . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley.” Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling, “You saved my life.” “Not really,” said Harry. “It was your soul the dementor would have taken. . . .” He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no con-tact during this summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that  morning  might  not  have  been  a  booby  trap  at  all.  Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley ap-peared  to  have  exhausted  his  ability  to  express  his  feelings.  After (cid:145) 40 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DURSLEYS DEPARTING opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided into scarlet-faced silence. Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approv-ing look that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather than Harry. “S-so sweet, Dudders . . .” she sobbed into his massive chest. “S-such a lovely b-boy . . . s-saying thank you . . .” “But he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia indignantly. “He only said he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!” “Yeah,  but  coming  from  Dudley  that’s  like  ‘I  love  you,’ ”  said Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Pe-tunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building. “Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living room door. “I thought we were on a tight schedule!” “Yes — yes, we are,” said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watch-ing these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. “We really must be off. Harry —” He  tripped  forward  and  wrung  Harry’s  hand  with  both  of  his own. “— good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizard-ing world rest upon your shoulders.” “Oh,” said Harry, “right. Thanks.” “Farewell,  Harry,”  said  Hestia,  also  clasping  his  hand.  “Our thoughts go with you.” “I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and Dudley. “Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said Diggle brightly, waving his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him. (cid:145) 41 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THREE Dudley  gently  released  himself  from  his  mother’s  clutches  and walked toward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then Dudley held out his large, pink hand. “Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs, “did the dementors blow a different personality into you?” “Dunno,” muttered Dudley. “See you, Harry.” “Yeah  .  .  .”  said  Harry,  taking  Dudley’s  hand  and  shaking  it. “Maybe. Take care, Big D.” Dudley  nearly  smiled,  then  lumbered  from  the  room.  Harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed. Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, looked around at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket, she said, “Well — good-bye,” and marched toward the door without looking at him. “Good-bye,” said Harry. She  stopped  and  looked  back.  For  a  moment  Harry  had  the strangest  feeling  that  she  wanted  to  say  something  to  him:  She gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out of the room after her husband and son. (cid:145) 42 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  F O U R THE SEVEN POTTERS     H arry  ran  back  upstairs  to  his  bedroom,  arriving  at  the window  just  in  time  to  see  the  Dursleys’  car  swinging out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus’s top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat. The car turned right  at  the  end  of  Privet  Drive,  its  windows  burned  scarlet  for  a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone. Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he depos-ited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on (cid:145) 43 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOUR Dudley’s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart’s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling to remember those times; it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost. “Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hed-wig,  who  was  still  sulking  with  her  head  under  her  wing.  “We’ll never be here again. Don’t you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories . . . Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the dementors. . . . Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? . . . And last summer, Dumble-dore walked through that front door. . . .” Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door. “And under here, Hedwig” — Harry pulled open a door under the stairs — “is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then — Blimey, it’s small, I’d forgotten. . . .” Harry  looked  around  at  the  stacked  shoes  and  umbrellas,  re-membering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once — Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted it — a flying motorbike . . . There  was  a  sudden,  deafening  roar  from  somewhere  nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head (cid:145) 44 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SEVEN  POTTERS on  the  low  door  frame.  Pausing  only  to  employ  a  few  of  Uncle Vernon’s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching  his  head  and  staring  out  of  the  window  into  the  back garden. The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar  attached.  All  around  him  other  people  were  dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses. Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There  was  a  general  cry  of  greeting  as  Hermione  flung  her  arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, “All righ’, Harry? Ready fer the off?” “Definitely,”  said  Harry,  beaming  around  at  them  all.  “But  I wasn’t expecting this many of you!” “Change of plan,” growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enor-mous,  bulging  sacks,  and  whose  magical  eye  was  spinning  from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. “Let’s get undercover before we talk you through it.” Harry  led  them  all  back  into  the  kitchen  where,  laughing  and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless appliances: Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his spectacles a little awry;  Mad-Eye,  battle-worn,  one-legged,  his  bright  blue  magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and (cid:145) 45 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOUR beautiful,  with  her  long  silvery  blonde  hair;  Kingsley,  bald,  black, broad-shouldered;  Hagrid,  with  his  wild  hair  and  beard,  standing hunchbacked  to  avoid  hitting  his  head  on  the  ceiling;  and  Mun-dungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy basset hound’s eyes and matted hair. Harry’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mund-ungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met. “Kingsley,  I  thought  you  were  looking  after  the  Muggle  Prime Minister?” he called across the room. “He  can  get  along  without  me  for  one  night,”  said  Kingsley. “You’re more important.” “Harry,  guess  what?”  said  Tonks  from  her  perch  on  top  of  the washing machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glit-tered there. “You got married?” Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin. “I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.” “That’s brilliant, congrat —” “All  right,  all  right,  we’ll  have  time  for  a  cozy  catch-up  later!” roared  Moody  over  the  hubbub,  and  silence  fell  in  the  kitchen. Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. “As Deda-lus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He’s made it an impris-onable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely pointless,  seeing  as  your  mother’s  charm  does  that  already.  What he’s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely. “Second problem: You’re underage, which means you’ve still got the Trace on you.” (cid:145) 46 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SEVEN  POTTERS “I don’t —” “The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently. “The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters. “We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In  short:  Pius  Thicknesse  thinks  he’s  got  you  cornered  good  and proper.” Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse. “So what are we going to do?” “We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.” Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them. “Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions: when you come of age, or” — Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen — “you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full under-standing that you’re never going to live together again, correct?” Harry nodded. “So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We’re choos-ing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen. “The  one  thing  we’ve  got  on  our  side  is  that  You-Know-Who doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail (cid:145) 47 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOUR to the Ministry: They think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t just rely on him getting the date wrong; he’s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we’re going to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house, Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s — you get the idea.” “Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan. “You’ll  be  going  to  Tonks’s  parents.  Once  you’re  within  the boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?” “Er — yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once” — he performed a quick headcount — “fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks’s parents’?” “Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a com-panion, each pair heading for a different safe house.” From  inside  his  cloak  Moody  now  withdrew  a  flask  of  what looked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately. “No!” he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. “No way!” “I told them you’d take it like this,” said Hermione with a hint of complacency. “If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives — !” (cid:145) 48 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SEVEN  POTTERS “— because it’s the first time for all of us,” said Ron. “This is different, pretending to be me —” “Well,  none  of  us  really  fancy  it,  Harry,”  said  Fred  earnestly. “Imagine  if  something  went  wrong  and  we  were  stuck  as  specky, scrawny gits forever.” Harry did not smile. “You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.” “Well,  that’s  that  plan  scuppered,”  said  George.  “Obviously there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.” “Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use magic; we’ve got no chance,” said Fred. “Funny,” said Harry, “really amusing.” “If  it  has  to  come  to  force,  then  it  will,”  growled  Moody,  his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. “Everyone  here’s  overage,  Potter,  and  they’re  all  prepared  to  take the risk.” Mundungus  shrugged  and  grimaced;  the  magical  eye  swerved sideways to glare at him out of the side of Moody’s head. “Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I want a few of your hairs, boy, now.” “But this is mad, there’s no need —” “No  need!”  snarled  Moody.  “With  You-Know-Who  out  there and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if we’re lucky he’ll have swallowed the fake bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on the  thirtieth,  but  he’d  be  mad  not  to  have  a  Death  Eater  or  two keeping an eye out, it’s what I’d do. They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother’s charm holds, but it’s about (cid:145) 49 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOUR to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only chance  is  to  use  decoys.  Even  You-Know-Who  can’t  split  himself into seven.” Harry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once. “So, Potter — some of your hair, if you please.” Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way. “Now!” barked Moody. With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled. “Good,” said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion. “Straight in here, if you please.” Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold. “Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,” said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, “Oh, you know what I mean — Goyle’s potion looked like bogies.” “Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,” said Moody. Ron,  Hermione,  Fred,  George,  and  Fleur  lined  up  in  front  of Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink. “We’re one short,” said Lupin. “Here,”  said  Hagrid  gruffly,  and  he  lifted  Mundungus  by  the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrin-kled  her  nose  pointedly  and  moved  along  to  stand  between  Fred and George instead. “I’ve toldjer, I’d sooner be a protector,” said Mundungus. “Shut it,” growled Moody. “As I’ve already told you, you spineless (cid:145) 50 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SEVEN  POTTERS worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Pot-ter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them.” Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already  pulling  half  a  dozen  eggcup-sized  glasses  from  inside  his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. “Altogether, then . . .” Ron,  Hermione,  Fred,  George,  Fleur,  and  Mundungus  drank. All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats: At  once,  their  features  began  to  bubble  and  distort  like  hot  wax. Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and George  were  shrinking;  their  hair  was  darkening,  Hermione’s  and Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls. Moody,  quite  unconcerned,  was  now  loosening  the  ties  of  the large  sacks  he  had  brought  with  him.  When  he  straightened  up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of him. Fred and George turned to each other and said together, “Wow — we’re identical!” “I  dunno,  though,  I  think  I’m  still  better-looking,”  said  Fred, examining his reflection in the kettle. “Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, “Bill, don’t look at me — I’m ’ideous.” “Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,” said Moody, indicating the first sack, “and vice versa. Don’t forget the glasses, there’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re dressed, there’s luggage in the other sack.” (cid:145) 51 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOUR The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pull-ing out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly much more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own. “I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,” said Ron, looking down at his bare chest. “Harry, your eyesight really is awful,” said Hermione, as she put on glasses. Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack. “Good,” said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden  Harrys  faced  him.  “The  pairs  will  be  as  follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom —” “Why’m I with you?” grunted the Harry nearest the back door. “Because you’re the one that needs watching,” growled Moody, and sure enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, “Arthur and Fred —” “I’m George,” said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. “Can’t you even tell us apart when we’re Harry?” “Sorry, George —” “I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really —” “Enough  messing  around!”  snarled  Moody.  “The  other  one  — George  or  Fred  or  whoever  you  are  —  you’re  with  Remus.  Miss Delacour —”  (cid:145) 52 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SEVEN  POTTERS “I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill. “She’s not that fond of brooms.” Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slav-ish look that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again. “Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral —” Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; Harry knew that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick. “Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him. Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione. “An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all righ’?” said Hagrid, looking a  little  anxious.  “We’ll  be  on  the  bike,  brooms  an’  thestrals  can’t take me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though, so you’ll be in the sidecar.” “That’s great,” said Harry, not altogether truthfully. “We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,” said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. “Snape’s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he’s never men-tioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re betting they’ll choose one of the Potters who look at home on a broomstick. All right then,” he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters’ clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, “I make it three minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No point locking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. . . . Come on. . . .” Harry  hurried  into  the  hall  to  fetch  his  rucksack,  Firebolt,  and Hedwig’s cage before joining the others in the dark back garden.   (cid:145) 53 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOUR On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already  been  helped  up  onto  a  great  black  thestral  by  Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on. “Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?” “The very same,” said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. “An’ the last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!” Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the  sidecar.  It  placed  him  several  feet  below  everybody  else:  Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car.  Harry  stuffed  his  rucksack  and  broomstick  down  by  his  feet and  rammed  Hedwig’s  cage  between  his  knees.  It  was  extremely uncomfortable. “Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, quite oblivious to  Harry’s  discomfort.  He  settled  himself  astride  the  motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. “It’s got a few tricks up its handlebars now. Tha’ one was my idea.” He  pointed  a  thick  finger  at  a  purple  button  near  the  speed-ometer. “Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside  them,  holding  his  broomstick.  “I’m  still  not  sure  that  was advisable and it’s certainly only to be used in emergencies.” “All right then,” said Moody. “Everyone ready, please; I want us  all  to  leave  at  exactly  the  same  time  or  the  whole  point  of  the diversion’s lost.” Everybody mounted their brooms. “Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side   (cid:145) 54 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SEVEN  POTTERS of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life: It roared like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. “Good luck, everyone,” shouted Moody. “See you all in about an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three. One . . . two . . . THREE.” There was  a  great roar from  the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch: He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him brooms  were  soaring  upward  too;  the  long  black  tail  of  a  thestral flicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig’s cage and his  rucksack,  were  already  sore  and starting  to go numb. So great was  his  discomfort  that  he  almost  forgot  to  take  a  last  glimpse  of number four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over the edge of the  sidecar  he  could  no  longer  tell  which  one  it  was.  Higher  and higher they climbed into the sky — And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At  least  thirty  hooded  figures,  suspended  in  midair,  formed  a vast  circle  in  the  midst  of  which  the  Order  members  had  risen, oblivious — Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were: Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig’s cage, the Firebolt, and his ruck-sack slipped from beneath his knees — “No — HEDWIG!” The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second’s relief, and then another   (cid:145) 55 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOUR burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. “No — NO!” The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle. “Hedwig — Hedwig —” But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He could not take it in, and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were — “Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back!” he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ram-ming Hedwig’s cage onto the floor, refusing to believe that she was dead. “Hagrid, TURN AROUND!” “My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, and he opened the throttle. “Stop  —  STOP!”  Harry  shouted,  but  as  he  looked  back  again two jets of green light flew past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken  away  from  the  circle  and  were  pursuing  them,  aiming  for Hagrid’s  broad  back.  Hagrid  swerved,  but  the  Death  Eaters  were keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around he cried, “Stupefy!” and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scat-tered to avoid it. “Hold on, Harry, this’ll do for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. (cid:145) 56 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SEVEN  POTTERS A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Cran-ing his neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky: He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up. More  Killing  Curses  flew  past  Harry’s  head  from  the  two  re-maining Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening — “Here we go again, Harry, hold on!” yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a second button. This time a great net burst from the bike’s ex-haust,  but  the  Death  Eaters  were  ready  for  it.  Not  only  did  they swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it. “This’ll  do  it,  Harry,  hold  on  tight!”  yelled  Hagrid,  and  Harry saw  him  slam  his  whole  hand  onto  the  purple  button  beside  the speedometer. With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eat-ers swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration. (cid:145) 57 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOUR “It’s all righ’, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto his back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike’s slipstream. “I’m on it, Harry, don’ worry!” Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella. “Hagrid! No! Let me!” “REPARO!” There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely: Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike’s flight, then the sidecar began to lose height — In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, “Wingardium Leviosa!” The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne: He had but a split second’s relief, however, as more curses streaked past him: The three Death Eaters were closing in. “I’m comin’, Harry!” Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, “Impedimenta!” The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him — Then  the  sidecar  began  to  fall  in  earnest,  and  the  remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat — “I’m comin’, Harry, I’m comin’!” A huge hand seized the back of Harry’s robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself (cid:145) 58 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SEVEN  POTTERS back-to-back with Hagrid. As they  soared  upward,  away  from  the two  remaining  Death  Eaters,  Harry  spat  blood  out  of  his  mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, “Confringo!” He  knew  a  dreadful,  gut-wrenching  pang  for  Hedwig  as  it  ex-ploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished. “Harry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned Hagrid, “I shouldn’ta tried ter repair it meself — yeh’ve got no room —” “It’s not a problem, just keep flying!” Harry shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer. As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid  swerved  and  zigzagged:  Harry  knew  that  Hagrid  did  not dare  use  the  dragon-fire  button  again,  with  Harry  seated  so  inse-curely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike — Stan — “Expelliarmus!” Harry yelled. “That’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!” The hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even above the thunder  of  the  motorbike’s  engine:  Next  moment,  both  pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view. “Harry,  what’s  happened?”  bellowed  Hagrid.  “Where’ve  they gone?” “I don’t know!” But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted “It’s the real one!”; how had he known? He gazed around at the appar-ently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they? (cid:145) 59 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOUR He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of Hagrid’s jacket. “Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of here!” “Hold on tight, then, Harry!” There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backward off what  little  of  the  seat  he  had,  Hagrid  flung  backward  upon  him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars — “I  think  we’ve  lost  ’em  Harry,  I  think  we’ve  done  it!”  yelled Hagrid. But Harry was not convinced: Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come. . . . Why had they fallen back? One of them had still had a wand. . . . It’s him . . . it’s the real one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan. . . . “We’re  nearly  there,  Harry,  we’ve  nearly  made  it!”  shouted Hagrid. Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars. Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire; as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind — And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snake-like face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again — Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying  at  random  into  the  whirling  night.  He  saw  a  body  fly  past (cid:145) 60 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SEVEN  POTTERS him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control — Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, which down: His scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, he saw it raise its arm — “NO!” With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the broomstick — Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard Voldemort scream, “Mine!” It was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, “Avada —” As  the  pain  from  Harry’s  scar  forced  his  eyes  shut,  his  wand acted of its own accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some great  magnet,  saw  a  spurt  of  golden  fire  through  his  half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death Eater  yelled;  Voldemort  screamed,  “No!”:  Somehow,  Harry  found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground. “Hagrid!”  Harry  called,  holding  on  to  the  bike  for  dear  life. “Hagrid — Accio Hagrid!” The motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth. Face level with the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing (cid:145) 61 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOUR nearer and nearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!” He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse him once more — And  then  Voldemort  vanished.  Harry  looked  down  and  saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard at  the  handlebars  to  avoid  hitting  him,  groped  for  the  brake,  but with  an  earsplitting,  ground-trembling  crash,  he  smashed  into  a muddy pond. (cid:145) 62 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  F I V E FALLEN WARRIOR     agrid?” H Harry  struggled  to  raise  himself  out  of  the  debris  of metal and leather that surrounded him; his hands sank into inches of  muddy  water  as  he  tried  to  stand.  He  could  not  understand where Voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the darkness  at  any  moment.  Something  hot  and  wet  was  trickling down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid. “Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me —” But the dark mass did not stir. “Who’s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?” Harry did not recognize the man’s voice. Then a woman shouted, “They’ve crashed, Ted! Crashed in the garden!” Harry’s head was swimming. “Hagrid,” he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled. (cid:145) 63 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like  cushions,  with  a  burning  sensation  in  his  ribs  and  right  arm. His missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead was still throbbing. “Hagrid?” He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an un-familiar, lamplit sitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man was watching Harry anxiously. “Hagrid’s fine, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing to him now. How  are  you  feeling?  Anything  else  broken?  I’ve  fixed  your  ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I’m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks — Dora’s father.” Harry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy. “Voldemort —” “Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry’s shoul-der and pushing him back against the cushions. “That was a nasty crash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?” “No,” said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. “Death Eaters, loads of them — we were chased —” “Death  Eaters?”  said  Ted  sharply.  “What  d’you  mean,  Death Eaters? I thought they didn’t know you were being moved tonight, I thought —” “They knew,” said Harry. Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above. (cid:145) 64 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR “Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don’t we? They shouldn’t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction.” Now  Harry  understood  why  Voldemort  had  vanished;  it  had been  at  the  point  when  the  motorbike  crossed  the  barrier  of  the Order’s charms. He only hoped they would continue to work: He imagined  Voldemort,  a  hundred  yards  above  them  as  they  spoke, looking  for  a  way  to  penetrate  what  Harry  visualized  as  a  great transparent bubble. He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his  own  eyes  before  he  would  believe  that  he  was  alive.  He  had barely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid squeezed through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but miraculously alive. “Harry!” Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs. “Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o’ that? I thought we were both goners.” “Yeah, me too. I can’t believe —” Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid. was empty. “You!” he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it “Your wand’s here, son,” said Ted, tapping it on Harry’s arm. “It fell right beside you, I picked it up. And that’s my wife you’re shouting at.” “Oh, I’m — I’m sorry.” As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks’s resemblance (cid:145) 65 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light, soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry’s exclamation. “What happened to our daughter?” she asked. “Hagrid said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?” “I don’t know,” said Harry. “We don’t know what happened to anyone else.” She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the sight of their expressions; if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He had consented to the plan, given them his hair. . . . “The Portkey,” he said, remembering all of a sudden. “We’ve got to get back to the Burrow and find out — then we’ll be able to send you word, or — or Tonks will, once she’s —” “Dora’ll be okay, ’Dromeda,” said Ted. “She knows her stuff, she’s been in plenty of tight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey’s through here,” he added to Harry. “It’s supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it.” “Yeah, we do,” said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders. “I —” He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for which  he  felt  so  terribly  respon-sible, but no words occurred to him that did not seem hollow and insincere. “I’ll tell Tonks — Dora — to send word, when she . . . Thanks for patching us up, thanks for everything. I —” He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel. (cid:145) 66 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR “There you go, son. That’s the Portkey.” Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the dressing table. “Thanks,” said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave. “Wait a moment,” said Hagrid, looking around. “Harry, where’s Hedwig?” “She . . . she got hit,” said Harry. The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys. Hagrid  reached  out  a  great  hand  and  patted  him  painfully  on the shoulder. life —” “Never mind,” he said gruffly. “Never mind. She had a great old “Hagrid!”  said  Ted  Tonks  warningly,  as  the  hairbrush  glowed bright blue, and Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time. With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spin-ning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Seconds later Harry’s feet slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. He heard screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet. “Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?” cried Mrs. Weasley. (cid:145) 67 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE “What d’you mean? Isn’t anyone else back?” Harry panted. The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley’s pale face. “The  Death  Eaters  were  waiting  for  us,”  Harry  told  her.  “We were surrounded the moment we took off — they knew it was to-night — I don’t know what happened to anyone else, four of them chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with us —” He  could  hear  the  self-justifying  note  in  his  voice,  the  plea  for her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons, but — “Thank goodness you’re all right,” she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved. “Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly?” asked Hagrid a little shakily. “Fer medicinal purposes?” She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward the crooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once. “Ron  and  Tonks  should  have  been  back  first,  but  they  missed their Portkey, it came back without them,” she said, pointing at a  rusty  oil  can  lying  on  the  ground  nearby.  “And  that  one,”  she pointed at an ancient sneaker, “should have been Dad and Fred’s, they were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,” she checked her watch, “if they made it, George and Lupin ought to be back in about a minute.” Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed  to  Hagrid.  He  uncorked  it  and  drank  it  straight  down  in one. “Mum!” shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away. (cid:145) 68 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR A  blue  light  had  appeared  in  the  darkness:  It  grew  larger  and brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry  knew  immediately  that  there  was  something  wrong:  Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood. Harry  ran  forward  and  seized  George’s  legs.  Together,  he  and Lupin carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the sitting room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell across George’s head, Ginny gasped and Harry’s stomach lurched: One of George’s ears was missing.  The  side  of  his  head  and  neck were drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood. No  sooner  had  Mrs.  Weasley  bent  over  her  son  than  Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door. “Oi!” said Hagrid indignantly. “Le’ go of him! Le’ go of Harry!” Lupin ignored him. “What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?” he said, giving Harry a small shake. “Answer me!” “A — a grindylow in a tank, wasn’t it?” Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. “Wha’ was tha’ about?” roared Hagrid. “I’m sorry, Harry, but I had to check,” said Lupin tersely. “We’ve been betrayed. Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor.” “So why aren’ you checkin’ me?” panted Hagrid, still struggling to fit through the door. (cid:145) 69 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE “You’re  half-giant,”  said  Lupin,  looking  up  at  Hagrid.  “The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.” “None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were mov-ing  tonight,”  said  Harry.  The  idea  was  dreadful  to  him,  he  could not believe it of any of them. “Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he didn’t know which one I was in the beginning. If he’d been in on the plan he’d have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.” “Voldemort  caught  up  with  you?”  said  Lupin  sharply.  “What happened? How did you escape?” Harry explained briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed  to  recognize  him  as  the  true  Harry,  how  they  had  aban-doned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks’s parents. “They recognized you? But how? What had you done?” “I . . .” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know, the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of — well, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!” Lupin looked aghast. “Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!” “We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself, and if I Stunned him and he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d used Avada Kedavra!  Expelliarmus  saved  me  from  Voldemort  two  years  ago,” Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering   (cid:145) 70 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how to Disarm. “Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great num-ber  of  Death  Eaters  witnessed  that  happening!  Forgive  me,  but  it was  a  very  unusual  move  then,  under  imminent  threat  of  death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!” “So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry angrily. “Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — frankly, most people! — would have expected you to attack back! Expelliar-mus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!” Lupin  was  making  Harry  feel  idiotic,  and  yet  there  was  still  a grain of defiance inside him. “I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said Harry. “That’s Voldemort’s job.” Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the  door,  Hagrid  staggered  to  a  chair  and  sat  down;  it  collapsed beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry ad-dressed Lupin again. “Will George be okay?” All Lupin’s frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question. “I think so, although there’s no chance of replacing his ear, not when it’s been cursed off —” There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt over Hagrid’s legs and sprinted into the yard.  (cid:145) 71 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermi-one flung herself into Harry’s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione’s shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin’s chest. “The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?” “ ‘Harry  is  the  best  hope  we  have.  Trust  him,’ ”  said  Lupin calmly. I’ve checked!” Kingsley  turned  his  wand  on  Harry,  but  Lupin  said,  “It’s  him, “All  right,  all  right!”  said  Kingsley,  stowing  his  wand  back  be-neath his cloak. “But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!” “So it seems,” replied Lupin, “but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven Harrys.” “Small comfort!” snarled Kingsley. “Who else is back?” “Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.” Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. “What happened to you?” Lupin asked Kingsley. “Followed  by  five,  injured  two,  might’ve  killed  one,”  Kingsley reeled off, “and we saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly. Remus, he can —” “Fly,” supplied Harry. “I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me.” “So that’s why he left, to follow you!” said Kingsley. “I couldn’t un-derstand why he’d vanished. But what made him change targets?” “Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,” said Lupin. “Stan?” repeated Hermione. “But I thought he was in Azkaban?” (cid:145) 72 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. “Hermione,  there’s  obviously  been  a  mass  breakout  which  the Ministry has hushed up. Travers’s hood fell off when I cursed him, he’s supposed to be inside too. But what happened to you, Remus? Where’s George?” “He lost an ear,” said Lupin. “Lost an — ?” repeated Hermione in a high voice. “Snape’s work,” said Lupin. “Snape?” shouted Harry. “You didn’t say —” “He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a speciality of Snape’s. I wish I could say I’d paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he was injured, he was losing so much blood.” Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no sign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying friends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus? “Harry, give us a hand!” called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him  free,  then  headed  through  the  empty  kitchen  and  back  into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by the  lamplight  Harry  saw  a  clean,  gaping  hole  where  George’s  ear had been. “How is he?” Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, “I can’t make it grow back, not when it’s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much worse. . . . He’s alive.” (cid:145) 73 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE “Yeah,” said Harry. “Thank God.” “Did I hear someone else in the yard?” Ginny asked. “Hermione and Kingsley,” said Harry. “Thank goodness,” Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen. “I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, now back off if you know what’s good for you!” Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured. “Arthur!” sobbed Mrs. Weasley. “Oh thank goodness!” “How is he?” Mr.  Weasley  dropped  to  his  knees  beside  George.  For  the  first time since Harry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin’s wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing. Perhaps  roused  by  the  sound  of  Fred  and  their  father’s  arrival, George stirred. “How do you feel, Georgie?” whispered Mrs. Weasley. George’s fingers groped for the side of his head. “Saintlike,” he murmured. “What’s  wrong  with  him?”  croaked  Fred,  looking  terrified.  “Is his mind affected?” “Saintlike,” repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. “You see . . . I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?” Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred’s pale face. (cid:145) 74 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR “Pathetic,” he told George. “Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?” “Ah well,” said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. “You’ll be able to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum.” He looked around. “Hi, Harry — you are Harry, right?” “Yeah, I am,” said Harry, moving closer to the sofa. “Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George. “Why aren’t Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed?” “They’re not back yet, George,” said Mrs. Weasley. George’s grin faded.  Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back  outside.  As  they  walked  through  the  kitchen  she  said  in  a low  voice,  “Ron  and  Tonks  should  be  back  by  now.  They  didn’t have a long journey; Auntie Muriel’s not that far from here.” Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand. Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky every time he turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None of them looked around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil. The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the  whispering  bush  or  tree  in  the  hope  that  one  of  the  missing Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves — (cid:145) 75 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE And then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground — “It’s them!” screamed Hermione. Tonks  landed  in  a  long  skid  that  sent  earth  and  pebbles everywhere. “Remus!” Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin’s arms. His face was set and white: He seemed unable to speak. Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione. “You’re okay,” he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly. “I thought — I thought —” “ ’M all right,” said Ron, patting her on the back. “ ’M fine.” “Ron was great,” said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin.  “Wonderful.  Stunned  one  of  the  Death  Eaters,  straight  to the head, and when you’re aiming at a moving target from a flying broom —” “You did?” said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck. “Always the tone of surprise,” he said a little grumpily, breaking free. “Are we the last back?” “No,” said Ginny, “we’re still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye and Mundungus. I’m going to tell Mum and Dad you’re okay, Ron —” She ran back inside. “So  what  kept  you?  What  happened?”  Lupin  sounded  almost angry at Tonks. “Bellatrix,” said Tonks. “She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, she tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I’d got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus. . . . Then we (cid:145) 76 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR got to Ron’s Auntie Muriel’s and we’d missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us —” A muscle was jumping in Lupin’s jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else. “So what happened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley. They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the  continued  absence  of  Bill,  Fleur,  Mad-Eye,  and  Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder to ignore. “I’m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an hour ago,” said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. “Let me know when they’re back.” Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into  the  darkness  toward  the  gate.  Harry  thought  he  heard  the faintest  pop  as  Kingsley  Disapparated  just  beyond  the  Burrow’s boundaries. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind  them.  Both  parents  hugged  Ron  before  turning  to  Lupin and Tonks. “Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley, “for our sons.” “Don’t be silly, Molly,” said Tonks at once. “How’s George?” asked Lupin. “What’s wrong with him?” piped up Ron. “He’s lost —” But the end of Mrs. Weasley’s sentence was drowned in a gen-eral outcry: A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet  from  them.  Bill  and  Fleur  slid  from  its  back,  windswept  but unhurt. (cid:145) 77 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE “Bill! Thank God, thank God —” Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. Looking directly at his father, he said, “Mad-Eye’s dead.” Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside  him  was  falling,  falling  through  the  earth,  leaving  him forever. “We  saw  it,”  said  Bill;  Fleur  nodded,  tear  tracks  glittering  on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window. “It happened just after we broke out of the circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by us, they were heading north too. Voldemort — he can fly — went straight  for  them.  Dung  panicked,  I  heard  him  cry  out,  Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort’s curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off his broom and — there was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our own tail —” Bill’s voice broke. “Of course you couldn’t have done anything,” said Lupin. They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite com-prehend it. Mad-Eye dead; it could not be. . . . Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor . . . At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no point waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. and Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow, and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing together. “What’s wrong?” said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered. “What’s happened? Who’s — ?” “Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Weasley. “Dead.” The twins’ grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed (cid:145) 78 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR to know what to do. Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief: She had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and his protégée at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief. Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-whisky and some glasses. “Here,” he said, and with a wave of his wand he sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them, holding the thir-teenth aloft. “Mad-Eye.” “Mad-Eye,” they all said, and drank. “Mad-Eye,” echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup. The firewhisky seared Harry’s throat. It seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, fir-ing him with something that was like courage. “So Mundungus disappeared?” said Lupin, who had drained his own glass in one. The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watch-ing  Lupin,  both  wanting  him  to  go  on,  it  seemed  to  Harry,  and slightly afraid of what they might hear. “I know what you’re thinking,” said Bill, “and I wondered that too, on the way back here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn’t they? But Mundungus can’t have betrayed us. They didn’t know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case you’ve forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn’t he have told them the essential point? I think Dung panicked, it’s as simple as that. He didn’t want to come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who went straight for them. It was enough to make anyone panic.” (cid:145) 79 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE “You-Know-Who  acted  exactly  as  Mad-Eye  expected  him  to,” sniffed Tonks. “Mad-Eye said he’d expect the real Harry to be with the  toughest,  most  skilled  Aurors.  He  chased  Mad-Eye  first,  and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley. . . .” “Yes, and zat eez all very good,” snapped Fleur, “but still eet does not explain ’ow zey knew we were moving ’Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must ’ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ’ole plan.” She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beau-tiful face, silently daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had just risked his own life to save Harry’s — Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon’s egg. . . . “No,”  Harry  said  aloud,  and  they  all  looked  at  him,  surprised: The firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice. “I mean . . . if somebody made a mistake,” Harry went on, “and let something slip, I know they didn’t mean to do it. It’s not their fault,” he repeated, again a little louder than he would usually have spoken. “We’ve got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don’t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort.” More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry  felt  a  little  hot  again,  and  drank  some  more  firewhisky  for something to do. As he drank,  he  thought  of  Mad-Eye.  Mad-Eye had always been scathing about Dumbledore’s willingness to trust people.  (cid:145) 80 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR “Well said, Harry,” said Fred unexpectedly. “Yeah, ’ear, ’ear,” said George, with half a glance at Fred, the cor-ner of whose mouth twitched. Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close to pitying. “You think I’m a fool?” demanded Harry. “No,  I  think  you’re  like  James,”  said  Lupin,  “who  would  have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.” Harry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had been betrayed by his friend, Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set down his glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, “There’s work to do. I can ask Kingsley whether —” “No,” said Bill at once, “I’ll do it, I’ll come.” “Where are you going?” said Tonks and Fleur together. “Mad-Eye’s body,” said Lupin. “We need to recover it.” “Can’t  it  —  ?”  began  Mrs.  Weasley  with  an  appealing  look  at Bill. “Wait?” said Bill. “Not unless you’d rather the Death Eaters took it?” Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good-bye and left. The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who remained standing. The suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence. “I’ve got to go too,” said Harry. Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him. “Don’t be silly, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What are you talk-ing about?”  (cid:145) 81 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE “I can’t stay here.” He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, it had not hurt like this for more than a year. “You’re all in danger while I’m here. I don’t want —” “But don’t be so silly!” said Mrs. Weasley. “The whole point of tonight was to get you here safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur’s agreed to get married here rather than in France, we’ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you —” She  did  not  understand;  she  was  making  him  feel  worse,  not better. “If Voldemort finds out I’m here —” “But why should he?” asked Mrs. Weasley. “There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley.  “He’s  got  no  way  of  knowing  which  safe  house  you’re in.” “It’s not me I’m worried for!” said Harry. “We know that,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left.” “Yer not goin’ anywhere,” growled Hagrid. “Blimey, Harry, after all we wen’ through ter get you here?” “Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?” said George, hoisting him-self up on his cushions. “I know that —” “Mad-Eye wouldn’t want —” “I KNOW!” Harry bellowed. He felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think he did not know what they had done for him, didn’t they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now, before they (cid:145) 82 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley. “Where’s Hedwig, Harry?” she said coaxingly. “We can put her up with Pigwidgeon and give her something to eat.” His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering. “Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,” said Hagrid. “Es-caped him, fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!” “It  wasn’t  me,”  said  Harry  flatly.  “It  was  my  wand.  My  wand acted of its own accord.” After a few moments, Hermione said gently, “But that’s impos-sible, Harry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.” “No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold flames appear before.” “Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before they’re trained —” “It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was  burning:  He  felt  angry  and  frustrated;  he  hated  the  idea  that they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemort’s. No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand per-forming magic on its own before. His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud. Muttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room. (cid:145) 83 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIVE As he crossed the dark yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up, rustled its enormous batlike wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore. Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would have known how and why Harry’s wand had acted indepen-dently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; he had known about  wands,  had  explained  to  Harry  the  strange  connection  that existed between his wand and Voldemort’s. . . . But Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all were gone where Harry could never talk to them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky . . . And  then,  out  of  nowhere,  the  pain  in  his  scar  peaked.  As  he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head. “You  told  me  the  problem  would  be  solved  by  using  another’s wand!” And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor, screaming, a horrible, drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable agony. . . . “No! No! I beg you, I beg you. . . .” “You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!” “I did not. . . . I swear I did not. . . .” “You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!” “I  swear  I  did  not.  .  .  .  I  believed  a  different  wand  would work. . . .” “Explain, then, what happened. Lucius’s wand is destroyed!” “I cannot understand. . . . The connection . . . exists only . . . be-tween your two wands. . . .” (cid:145) 84 (cid:145) \\x0cFALLEN WARRIOR “Lies!” “Please . . . I beg you. . . .” And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort’s surge of vicious anger, saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in agony — “Harry?” It was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was several moments before he realized that Ron and Hermione were at his side. “Harry,  come  back  in  the  house,”  Hermione  whispered.  “You aren’t still thinking of leaving?” “Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said Ron, thumping Harry on the back. “Are you all right?” Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry’s face. “You look awful!” “Well,”  said  Harry  shakily,  “I  probably  look  better  than  Olli-vander. . . .” When  he  had  finished  telling  them  what  he  had  seen,  Ron looked appalled, but Hermione downright terrified. “But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar — it wasn’t sup-posed to do this anymore! You mustn’t let that connection open up again — Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!” When he did not reply, she gripped his arm. “Harry, he’s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding world! Don’t let him inside your head too!” (cid:145) 85 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  S I X  THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS    T he shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that followed; Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other Order members, who passed in and out to relay news. Harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible. “Well,  you  can’t  do  anything  about  the”  —  Ron  mouthed  the word Horcruxes — “till you’re seventeen. You’ve still got the Trace on you. And we can plan here as well as anywhere, can’t we? Or,” he dropped his voice to a whisper, “d’you reckon you already know where the You-Know-Whats are?” “No,” Harry admitted. “I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said Ron. “She said she was saving it for when you got here.” They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had   (cid:145) 86 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS just left for work. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath. “The Trace’ll break on the thirty-first,” said Harry. “That means I only need to stay here four days. Then I can —” “Five days,” Ron corrected him firmly. “We’ve got to stay for the wedding. They’ll kill us if we miss it.” Harry understood “they” to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley. “It’s one extra day,” said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous. “Don’t they realize how important — ?” “ ’Course they don’t,” said Ron. “They haven’t got a clue. And now you mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.” Ron  glanced  toward  the  door  into  the  hall  to  check  that  Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry. “Mum’s  been  trying  to  get  it  out  of  Hermione  and  me.  What we’re  off  to  do.  She’ll  try  you  next,  so  brace  yourself.  Dad  and Lupin’ve both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She’s determined.” Ron’s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs. Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man’s sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen, she started. “Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are drop-ping out of Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone. “Oh,” said Harry. “Well, yeah. We are.” The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like one of Mr. Weasley’s vests.  (cid:145) 87 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX “May I ask why you are abandoning your education?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Well,  Dumbledore  left  me  .  .  .  stuff  to  do,”  mumbled  Harry. “Ron and Hermione know about it, and they want to come too.” “What sort of ‘stuff’?” “I’m sorry, I can’t —” “Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I’m  sure  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Granger  would  agree!”  said  Mrs.  Weasley. Harry had been afraid of the “concerned parent” attack. He forced himself  to  look  directly  into  her  eyes,  noticing  as  he  did  so  that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny’s. This did not help. “Dumbledore didn’t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I’m sorry. Ron and Hermione don’t have to come, it’s their choice —” “I don’t see that you have to go either!” she snapped, dropping all pretense now. “You’re barely of age, any of you! It’s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you —” “I didn’t misunderstand,” said Harry flatly. “It’s got to be me.” He handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be iden-tifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes. “And that’s not mine, I don’t support Puddlemere United.” “Oh, of course not,” said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone. “I should have realized. Well, Harry, while we’ve still got you here, you won’t mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur’s wedding, will you? There’s still so much to do.” (cid:145) 88 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS “No — I — of course not,” said Harry, disconcerted by this sud-den change of subject. “Sweet  of  you,”  she  replied,  and  she  smiled  as  she  left  the scullery. From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron, and Her-mione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had  any  time  to  think.  The  kindest  explanation  of  this  behavior would  have  been  that  Mrs.  Weasley  wanted  to  distract  them  all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey. After  two  days  of  nonstop  cutlery  cleaning,  of  color-matching  fa-vors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canapés, however, Harry started to  suspect  her  of  a  different  motive.  All  the  jobs  she  handed  out seemed to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander. “I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she’ll be able to delay you leaving,” Ginny told Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay. “And then what does she think’s going to happen?” Harry mut-tered. “Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she’s holding us here making vol-au-vents?” He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny’s face whiten. “So it’s true?” she said. “That’s what you’re trying to do?” “I — not — I was joking,” said Harry evasively. They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock  in  Ginny’s  expression.  Suddenly  Harry  became  aware  that (cid:145) 89 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was remembering them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked in. They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that after the death of  Dumbledore,  their  Secret-Keeper,  each  of  the  people  to  whom Dumbledore had confided Grimmauld Place’s location had become a Secret-Keeper in turn. “And  as  there  are  around  twenty  of  us,  that  greatly  dilutes  the power of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for  the  Death  Eaters  to  get  the  secret out of somebody. We can’t expect it to hold much longer.” “But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?” asked Harry. “Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again. We hope they’ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but we can’t be sure. It would have been insane to keep us-ing the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky.” The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to ma-neuver  knives  and  forks.  Harry  found  himself  crammed  beside Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated  by a few  more  people. He was trying  so  hard  to  avoid  brushing  her  arm  he  could  barely  cut  his chicken. “No news about Mad-Eye?” Harry asked Bill. (cid:145) 90 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS “Nothing,” replied Bill. They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and Lupin had failed to recover his body. It had been difficult to  know  where  he  might  have  fallen,  given  the  darkness  and  the confusion of the battle. “The Daily Prophet hasn’t said a word about him dying or about finding the body,” Bill went on. “But that doesn’t mean much. It’s keeping a lot quiet these days.” “And  they  still  haven’t  called  a  hearing  about  all  the  underage magic  I  used  escaping  the  Death  Eaters?”  Harry  called  across  the table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head. “Because they know I had no choice or because they don’t want me to tell the world Voldemort attacked me?” “The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban’s seen a mass breakout.” “Yeah, why tell the public the truth?” said Harry, clenching his knife  so  tightly  that  the  faint  scars  on  the  back  of  his  right  hand stood out, white against his skin: I must not tell lies. “Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?” asked Ron angrily. “Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,” Mr. Weasley replied, “terrified that they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one don’t believe  the  Muggle  Studies  professor  at  Hogwarts  resigned.  She hasn’t  been  seen  for  weeks  now.  Meanwhile  Scrimgeour  remains shut up in his office all day: I just hope he’s working on a plan.” There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart. (cid:145) 91 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX “We  must  decide  ’ow  you  will  be  disguised,  ’Arry,”  said  Fleur, once everyone had pudding. “For ze wedding,” she added, when he looked confused. “Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ’ave ’ad champagne.” From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid. “Yes, good point,” said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table, where she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scan-ning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. “Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?” “Why?” exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. “Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!” “We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few days’ time, young man —” “And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked Ron furi-ously. “No! So why in the name of Merlin’s saggy left —” “Don’t talk to your mother like that,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “And do as you’re told.” Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart. “I  can  help,  some  of  it’s  my  mess,”  Harry  told  Ron,  but  Mrs. Weasley cut across him. “No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the chickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they’re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.” But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens. (cid:145) 92 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS “There’s  no  need  to,  er,  mention  it  to  Molly,”  Mr.  Weasley  told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius’s bike and, er, I’m hiding — that’s to say, keeping — it in here. Fantastic stuff: There’s an exhaust gas-kin, as I believe it’s called, the most magnificent battery, and it’ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. I’m going to try and put it all back together again when Molly’s not — I mean, when I’ve got time.” When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry slipped upstairs to Ron’s attic bedroom. “I’m doing it, I’m doing — ! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had  evidently  just  vacated.  The  room  was  just  as  messy  as  it  had been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in  the  far  corner,  her  fluffy  ginger  cat,  Crookshanks,  at  her  feet, sorting  books,  some  of  which  Harry  recognized  as  his  own,  into two enormous piles. “Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. “And how did you manage to get away?” “Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the  sheets  yesterday,”  said  Hermione.  She  threw  Numerology  and Grammatica  onto  one  pile  and  The  Rise  and  Fall  of  the  Dark  Arts onto the other. “We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” Ron told Harry. “I reckon he might have survived.” “But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,” said Harry. “Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,” said Ron. “How can he be sure what he saw?” “Even  if  the  Killing  Curse  missed,  Mad-Eye  still  fell  about  a (cid:145) 93 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX thousand feet,” said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of  Britain and Ireland in her hand. “He could have used a Shield Charm —” “Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,” said Harry. “Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron grumpily, punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape. “Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said Hermione, looking shocked. “It’s dreadful that he’s dead! But we’re being realistic!” For  the  first  time,  Harry  imagined  Mad-Eye’s  body,  broken  as Dumbledore’s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket.  He  felt  a  stab  of  revulsion  mixed  with  a  bizarre  desire  to laugh. “The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s why no one’s found him,” said Ron wisely. “Yeah,” said Harry. “Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid’s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him —” “Don’t!”  squealed  Hermione.  Startled,  Harry  looked  over  just in  time  to  see  her  burst  into  tears  over  her  copy  of  Spellman’s Syllabary. “Oh  no,”  said  Harry,  struggling  to  get  up  from  the  old  camp bed. “Hermione, I wasn’t trying to upset —” But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, “Tergeo.” The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased   (cid:145) 94 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS with  himself,  Ron  handed  the  slightly  smoking  handkerchief  to Hermione. “Oh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I’m sorry. . . .” She blew her nose and hiccuped. “It’s just so awf-ful, isn’t it? R-right after Dumbledore . . . I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so tough!” “Yeah, I know,” said Ron, giving her a squeeze. “But you know what he’d say to us if he was here?” “ ‘C-constant vigilance,’ ” said Hermione, mopping her eyes. “That’s  right,”  said  Ron,  nodding.  “He’d  tell  us  to  learn  from what happened to him. And what I’ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.” Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at Ron’s ankle. “I’m  sorry,  I’m  sorry!”  Hermione  cried  as  Harry  wrenched  the book from Ron’s leg and retied it shut. “What are you doing with all those books anyway?” Ron asked, limping back to his bed. “Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione. “When we’re looking for the Horcruxes.” “Oh,  of  course,”  said  Ron,  clapping  a  hand  to  his  forehead.  “I forgot we’ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.” “Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at Spellman’s Syllabary. “I wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I think we’d better take it, to be safe.”  (cid:145) 95 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX She  dropped  the  syllabary  onto  the  larger  of  the  two  piles  and picked up Hogwarts, A History. “Listen,” said Harry. He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance. “I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come with me,” Harry began. “Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes. “As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books. “You know, I think I will take Hogwarts, A History. Even if we’re not going back there, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with —” “Listen!” said Harry again. “No, Harry, you listen,” said Hermione. “We’re coming with you. That was decided months ago — years, really.” “But —” “Shut up,” Ron advised him. “— are you sure you’ve thought this through?” Harry persisted. “Let’s  see,”  said  Hermione,  slamming  Travels  with  Trolls  onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. “I’ve been packing for days, so we’re ready to leave at a moment’s notice, which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling Mad-Eye’s whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron’s mum’s nose. “I’ve  also  modified  my  parents’  memories  so  that  they’re  con-vinced they’re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life’s ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That’s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them   (cid:145) 96 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS down and interrogate them about me — or you, because unfortu-nately, I’ve told them quite a bit about you. “Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don’t — well, I think I’ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don’t know that they’ve got a daughter, you see. Hermione’s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off  the  bed,  put  his  arm  around  her  once  more,  and  frowned  at Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact. “I — Hermione, I’m sorry — I didn’t —” “Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you’ve done.” “Nah, he’s just eaten,” said Ron. “Go on, he needs to know!” “Oh, all right. Harry, come here.” For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermi-one and stumped over to the door. “C’mon.” “Why?”  Harry  asked,  following  Ron  out  of  the  room  onto  the tiny landing. “Descendo,” muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains.  (cid:145) 97 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX “That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Harry, who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence. “Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder. “Come and have a look at him.” Harry  followed  Ron  up  the  few  short  steps  into  the  tiny  attic space. His head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open. “But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas?” “No,” said Ron. “Nor have they usually got red hair or that num-ber of pustules.” Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry’s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron’s pajamas. He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters. “He’s me, see?” said Ron. “No,” said Harry. “I don’t.” “I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me,” said Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books. “Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live down here in my room,” said Ron. “I think he’s really looking forward to it — well, it’s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool — but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he’s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?” Harry merely looked his confusion. “It  is!”  said  Ron,  clearly  frustrated  that  Harry  had  not  grasped the brilliance of the plan. “Look, when we three don’t turn up at (cid:145) 98 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS Hogwarts again, everyone’s going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they’ve got information on where you are.” “But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a  lot  of  Muggle-borns  are  talking  about  going  into  hiding  at  the moment,” said Hermione. “We can’t hide my whole family, it’ll look too fishy and they can’t all leave their jobs,” said Ron. “So we’re going to put out the story that I’m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can’t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit’s really contagious, so they’re not going to want to go near him. It won’t matter that he can’t say anything, either, because apparently you can’t once the fungus has spread to your uvula.” “And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked Harry. “Dad  is.  He  helped  Fred  and  George  transform  the  ghoul. Mum . . . well, you’ve seen what she’s like. She won’t accept we’re going till we’ve gone.” There  was  silence  in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione  continued  to  throw  books  onto  one  pile  or  the  other. Ron  sat  watching  her,  and  Harry  looked  from  one  to  the  other, unable  to  say  anything.  The  measures  they  had  taken  to  protect their  families  made  him  realize,  more  than  anything  else  could have done, that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply could not find words important enough. Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four floors below. (cid:145) 99 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX “Ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,” said Ron. “I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.” “Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she’s too young to come on her own,” said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee. “Well,  guests  aren’t  going  to  help  Mum’s  stress  levels,”  said Ron. “What we really need to decide,” said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up  An  Appraisal  of  Magical  Education  in  Europe,  “is  where  we’re going  after  we  leave  here.  I  know  you  said  you  wanted  to  go  to Godric’s Hollow first, Harry, and I understand why, but . . . well . . . shouldn’t we make the Horcruxes our priority?” “If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d agree with you,” said Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to return to Godric’s Hollow. His parents’ graves were only part of the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemort’s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened, wanting to understand. “Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked. “He might expect you to go back and visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to go wherever you like?” This  had  not  occurred  to  Harry.  While  he  struggled  to  find  a counterargument, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train of thought. (cid:145) 100 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS “This R.A.B. person,” he said. “You know, the one who stole the real locket?” Hermione nodded. “He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?” Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.’s note was still folded. “ ‘I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can,’ ” Harry read out. “Well, what if he did finish it off?” said Ron. “Or she,” interposed Hermione. “Whichever,” said Ron, “it’d be one less for us to do!” “Yes,  but  we’re  still  going  to  have  to  try  and  trace  the  real locket, aren’t we?” said Hermione, “to find out whether or not it’s destroyed.” “And  once  we  get  hold  of  it,  how  do  you  destroy  a  Horcrux?” asked Ron. “Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.” “How?”  asked  Harry.  “I  didn’t  think  there  were  any  books  on Horcruxes in the library?” “There weren’t,” said Hermione, who had turned pink. “Dumble-dore removed them all, but he — he didn’t destroy them.” Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed. “How in the name of Merlin’s  pants  have  you  managed  to  get your hands on those Horcrux books?” “It — it wasn’t stealing!” said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. “They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn’t want anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have made it much harder to —” (cid:145) 101 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX “Get to the point!” said Ron. “Well . . . it was easy,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I just did a Summoning Charm. You know — Accio. And — they zoomed out of Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.” “But when did you do this?” Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity. “Just after his — Dumbledore’s — funeral,” said Hermione in an  even  smaller  voice.  “Right  after  we  agreed  we’d  leave  school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things it — it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I tried . . . and it worked. They flew straight in through the open window and I — I packed them.” She swallowed and then said imploringly, “I can’t believe Dum-bledore would have been angry, it’s not as though we’re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?” “Can  you  hear  us  complaining?”  said  Ron.  “Where  are  these books anyway?” Hermione  rummaged  for  a  moment  and  then  extracted  from the pile a large volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something re-cently dead. “This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art — it’s a horrible book, really awful,  full  of  evil  magic.  I  wonder  when  Dumbledore  removed  it from the library. . . . If he didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.” “Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he’d already read that?” asked Ron. (cid:145) 102 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS “He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,” said Harry. “Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn  about  them.  I  think  you’re  right,  Hermione,  that  could easily have been where he got the information.” “And the more I’ve read about them,” said Hermione, “the more horrible they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!” Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond “usual evil.” “Isn’t  there  any  way  of  putting  yourself  back  together?”  Ron asked. “Yes,” said Hermione with a hollow smile, “but it would be ex-cruciatingly painful.” “Why? How do you do it?” asked Harry. “Remorse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to really feel what you’ve done. There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can’t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?” “No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?” “Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examin-ing rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read, what Harry did to Riddle’s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.” “What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry. “Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,” said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.” (cid:145) 103 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX “It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t re-pair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly rare — “— phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding. “Exactly,” said Hermione. “Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all danger-ous to carry around with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won’t do the trick. You’ve got to put it beyond magical repair.” “But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can’t the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?” “Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.” Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermi-one hurried on, “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.” “Which  would  be  a  real  comfort  to  me,  I’m  sure,”  said  Ron. Harry laughed. “It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to  your  body,  your  soul  will  survive, untouched,” said Hermione. “But it’s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can’t exist without it.” “That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said Harry, remem-bering  ink  pouring  like  blood  from  the  punctured  pages,  and  the screams of the piece of Voldemort’s soul as it vanished. “And  once  the  diary  was  properly  destroyed,  the  bit  of  soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the   (cid:145) 104 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.” “Hang on,” said Ron, frowning. “The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?” “While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don’t mean holding it for too long, it’s nothing to do with touching it,” she added before Ron could speak. “I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incred-ibly vulnerable. You’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.” “I  wonder  how  Dumbledore  destroyed  the  ring?”  said  Harry. “Why didn’t I ask him? I never really . . .” His voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have  asked  Dumbledore,  and  of  how,  since  the  headmaster  had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more . . . to find out everything. . . . The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking  crash.  Hermione  shrieked  and  dropped  Secrets  of  the Darkest  Art;  Crookshanks  streaked  under  the  bed,  hissing  indig-nantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage. “I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” she said, her voice trembling. “I’m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are   (cid:145) 105 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.” “Oh  yes,”  said  Hermione,  looking  terrified  as  she  leapt  to  her feet,  sending  books  flying  in  every  direction,  “we  will  .  .  .  we’re sorry . . .” With  an  anguished  look  at  Harry  and  Ron,  Hermione  hurried out of the room after Mrs. Weasley. “It’s  like  being  a  house-elf,”  complained  Ron  in  an  undertone, still massaging his head as he and Harry followed. “Except without the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding’s over, the happier I’ll be.” “Yeah,” said Harry, “then we’ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes. . . . It’ll be like a holiday, won’t it?” Ron  started  to  laugh,  but  at  the  sight  of  the  enormous  pile  of wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs. Weasley’s room, stopped quite abruptly. The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o’clock. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling quite resentful to-ward Fleur’s family by this time, and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped  back  upstairs  to  put  on  matching  socks,  and  Harry  at-tempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough,  they  trooped  out  into  the  sunny  backyard  to  await  the visitors. Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty caul-drons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden (cid:145) 106 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather for-lorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes. He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusu-ally high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage and  leading  a  beautiful  blonde  woman  in  long,  leaf-green  robes, who could only be Fleur’s mother. “Maman!” cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. “Papa!” Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed black beard.  However,  he  looked  good-natured.  Bouncing  toward  Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her flustered. “You ’ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep voice. “Fleur tells us you ’ave been working very ’ard.” “Oh, it’s been nothing, nothing!” trilled Mrs. Weasley. “No trou-ble at all!” Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes. “Dear lady!” said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley’s hand between his own two plump ones and beaming. “We are most honored at the approaching union of our two families! Let me pres-ent my wife, Apolline.” (cid:145) 107 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Wea-sley too. “Enchantée,” she said. “Your ’usband ’as been telling us such amus-ing stories!” Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look,  upon  which  he  became  immediately  silent  and  assumed  an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend. “And, of course, you ’ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!” said Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old,  with  waist-length  hair  of  pure,  silvery  blonde,  she  gave  Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glow-ing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly. “Well, come in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours into the house, with many “No, please!”s and “After you!”s and “Not at all!”s. The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the prepa-rations  for  the  wedding.  Monsieur  Delacour  pronounced  every-thing from the seating plan to the bridesmaids’ shoes “Charmant!” Madame Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister  around,  trying  to  assist  in  any  way  she  could  and  jabbering away in rapid French. On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sit-ting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour’s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percy’s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Char-  (cid:145) 108 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GHOUL  IN PAJAMAS lie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house. “But she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled Ron, as their second attempt  at  a  meeting  in  the  yard  was  foiled  by  the  appearance  of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms. “Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens,” she called as she approached them.  “We’d  better  shut  them  away  again  before  the  men  arrive tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the wedding,” she explained, pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. “Mil-lamant’s  Magic  Marquees  .  .  .  they’re  very  good,  Bill’s  escorting them. . . . You’d better stay inside while they’re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these secu-rity spells around the place.” “I’m sorry,” said Harry humbly. “Oh, don’t be silly, dear!” said Mrs. Weasley at once. “I didn’t mean  —  well,  your  safety’s  much  more  important!  Actually,  I’ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, it’s an important day. . . .” “I  don’t  want  a  fuss,”  said  Harry  quickly,  envisaging  the  addi-tional  strain  this  would  put  on  them  all.  “Really,  Mrs.  Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine. . . . It’s the day before the wed-ding. . . .” “Oh, well, if you’re sure, dear. I’ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid?” “That’d be great,” said Harry. “But please  don’t  go  to loads  of trouble.”  (cid:145) 109 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIX “Not at all, not at all . . . It’s no trouble. . . .” She  looked  at  him,  a  long,  searching  look,  then  smiled  a  little sadly,  straightened  up,  and  walked  away.  Harry  watched  as  she waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her. (cid:145) 110 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  S E V E N  THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE  H e  was  walking  along  a  mountain  road  in  the  cool  blue light  of  dawn.  Far  below,  swathed  in  mist,  was  the shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought down there, the man he needed so badly he could think of little else, the man who held the answer, the answer to his problem . . . ? “Oi, wake up.” Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron’s dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing. The scar on Harry’s forehead was prickling. “You were muttering in your sleep.” “Was I?” “Yeah. ‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.’ ” Harry  was  not  wearing  his  glasses;  Ron’s  face  appeared  slightly blurred. “Who’s Gregorovitch?” (cid:145) 111 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN “I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it.” Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name before, but he could not think where. “I think Voldemort’s looking for him.” “Poor bloke,” said Ron fervently. Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley. “I think he’s abroad.” “Who, Gregorovitch?” “Voldemort. I think he’s somewhere abroad, looking for Grego-rovitch. It didn’t look like anywhere in Britain.” “You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?” Ron sounded worried. “Do me a favor and don’t tell Hermione,” said Harry. “Although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep . . .” He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon’s cage, thinking . . . Why was the name “Gregorovitch” familiar? “I think,” he said slowly, “he’s got something to do with Quid-ditch. There’s some connection, but I can’t — I can’t think what it is.” “Quidditch?”  said  Ron.  “Sure  you’re  not  thinking  of  Gorgo-vitch?” “Who?” “Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Can-nons for a record fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season.” “No,” said Harry. “I’m definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch.” (cid:145) 112 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE “I try not to either,” said Ron. “Well, happy birthday anyway.” “Wow — that’s right, I forgot! I’m seventeen!” Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses, and said, “Accio Glasses!” Although they were only around a foot away, there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, at least until they poked him in the eye. “Slick,” snorted Ron. Reveling  in  the  removal  of  his Trace, Harry sent Ron’s posses-sions flying around the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron’s Chudley Cannons posters bright blue. “I’d do your fly by hand, though,” Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry immediately checked it. “Here’s your present. Unwrap it up here, it’s not for my mother’s eyes.” “A book?” said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. “Bit of a departure from tradition, isn’t it?” “This isn’t your average book,” said Ron. “It’s pure gold: Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I’d had this last year I’d have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would’ve known how to get going with . . . Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I’ve learned a lot. You’d be surprised, it’s not all about wandwork, either.” When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting  on  the  table.  Bill  and  Monsieur  Delacour  were  finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan. (cid:145) 113 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN “Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. “He had to leave early for work, but he’ll be back for dinner. That’s our present on top.” Harry  sat  down,  took  the  square  parcel  she  had  indicated,  and unwrapped it. Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the face instead of hands. “It’s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,” said Mrs. Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. “I’m afraid that one isn’t new like Ron’s, it was actually my brother Fabian’s and he wasn’t terribly careful with his possessions, it’s a bit dented on the back, but —” The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood  them,  because  she  patted  his  cheek  clumsily  when  he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor. “Happy  birthday,  Harry!”  said  Hermione,  hurrying  into  the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile. “It’s not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?” she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her. “Come on, then, open Hermione’s!” said Ron. She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages con-tained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (“Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever ’ave,” Monsieur Delacour as-sured him, “but you must tell it clearly what you want . . . ozzerwise you might find you ’ave a leetle less hair zan you would like. . . .”), chocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George. (cid:145) 114 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the ar-rival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. “I’ll pack these for you,” Hermione said brightly, taking Harry’s presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs. “I’m nearly done, I’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash, Ron —” Ron’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing. “Harry, will you come in here a moment?” It was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room. He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-witch Quid-ditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny  had  once  played  two-a-side  Quidditch  with  Ron  and  Her-mione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on top was level with Ginny’s window. Ginny looked up into Harry’s face, took a deep breath, and said, “Happy seventeenth.” “Yeah . . . thanks.” She was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it difficult to look back at her; it was like gazing into a brilliant light. “Nice view,” he said feebly, pointing toward the window. She ignored this. He could not blame her. “I couldn’t think what to get you,” she said. (cid:145) 115 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN “You didn’t have to get me anything.” She disregarded this too. “I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn’t be able to take it with you.” He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have tough-ened her up. She took a step closer to him. “So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember me  by,  you  know,  if  you  meet  some  veela  when  you’re  off  doing whatever you’re doing.” “I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest.” “There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion, better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair — The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. “Oh,” said Ron pointedly. “Sorry.” “Ron!” Hermione was just behind him, slightly out of breath. There was a strained silence, then Ginny said in a flat little voice, “Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.” Ron’s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened, and his shining mo-ment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for ending his (cid:145) 116 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone. He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that she  might  have  succumbed,  for  once,  to  tears.  He  could  not  do anything to comfort her in front of Ron. “I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking scared. Once  he  reached  the  seclusion  of  the  freshly  mown  lawn,  Ron rounded on Harry. around?” “You  ditched  her.  What  are  you  doing  now,  messing  her “I’m not messing her around,” said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them. “Ron —” But Ron held up a hand to silence her. “She was really cut up when you ended it —” “So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t because I wanted to.” “Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get her hopes up again —” “She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting us to — to end up married, or —” As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry’s mind of Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger. (cid:145) 117 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and unencumbered, whereas his . . . he could see nothing but Vol-demort ahead. “If you keep groping her every chance you get —” “It won’t happen again,” said Harry harshly. The day was cloud-less, but he felt as though the sun had gone in. “Okay?” Ron  looked  half  resentful,  half  sheepish;  he  rocked  backward and forward on his feet for a moment, then said, “Right then, well, that’s . . . yeah.” Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the  rest  of  the  day,  nor  by  any  look  or  gesture  did  she  show  that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. Nev-ertheless,  Charlie’s  arrival  came  as  a  relief  to  Harry.  It  provided  a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut. As  Harry’s  birthday  dinner  would  have  stretched  the  Burrow’s kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks,  and  Hagrid,  several  tables  were  placed  end  to  end  in  the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns, all emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s ministrations, George’s wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins’ many jokes about it. Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of  her  wand  and  drape  themselves  artistically  over  the  trees  and bushes. “Nice,” said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione   (cid:145) 118 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. “You’ve really got an eye for that sort of thing.” “Thank you, Ron!” said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little  confused.  Harry  turned  away,  smiling  to  himself.  He  had  a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny’s eye and grinned at her before remem-bering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour. “Out  of  the  way,  out  of  the  way!”  sang  Mrs.  Weasley,  coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand,  rather  than  risk  carrying  it over the uneven ground. When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, “That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it’s nothing, dear,” she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one. By seven o’clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best, and horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry’s hand, Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant. “Happy birthday, Harry,” she said, hugging him tightly. “Seventeen, eh!” said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from Fred. “Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d’yeh remember it?”  (cid:145) 119 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN “Vaguely,” said Harry, grinning up at  him.  “Didn’t  you  smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?” “I  forge’  the  details,”  Hagrid  chortled.  “All  righ’,  Ron, Hermione?” “We’re fine,” said Hermione. “How are you?” “Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns, I’ll show yeh when yeh get back —” Harry avoided Ron’s and Hermione’s gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. “Here, Harry — couldn’ think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.” He pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. “Mokeskin. Hide anythin’ in there an’ no one but the owner can get it out. They’re rare, them.” “Hagrid, thanks!” “ ’S’nothin’,” said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. “An’ there’s Charlie! Always liked him — hey! Charlie!” Charlie  approached,  running  his  hand  slightly  ruefully  over  his new, brutally short haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his muscley arms. “Hi, Hagrid, how’s it going?” “Bin meanin’ ter write fer ages. How’s Norbert doin’?” “Norbert?”  Charlie  laughed.  “The  Norwegian  Ridgeback?  We call her Norberta now.” “Wha — Norbert’s a girl?” “Oh yeah,” said Charlie. “How can you tell?” asked Hermione. “They’re  a  lot  more  vicious,”  said  Charlie.  He  looked  over  his shoulder and dropped his voice. “Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum’s getting edgy.” (cid:145) 120 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate. “I think we’d better start without Arthur,” she called to the gar-den at large after a moment or two. “He must have been held up at — oh!” They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came fly-ing across the yard and onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright  silver  weasel,  which  stood  on  its  hind  legs  and  spoke  with Mr. Weasley’s voice. “Minister of Magic coming with me.” The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur’s family peer-ing in astonishment at the place where it had vanished. “We shouldn’t be here,” said Lupin at once. “Harry — I’m sorry — I’ll explain another time —” He  seized  Tonks’s  wrist  and  pulled  her  away;  they  reached  the fence, climbed over it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. “The Minister — but why — ? I don’t understand —” But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus  Scrimgeour,  instantly  recognizable  by  his  mane  of  grizzled hair. The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern-lit table, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy and grim. “Sorry to intrude,” said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. “Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party.” (cid:145) 121 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. “Many happy returns.” “Thanks,” said Harry. “I require a private word with you,” Scrimgeour went on. “Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.” “Us?” said Ron, sounding surprised. “Why us?” “I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,” said Scrimgeour. “Is there such a place?” he demanded of Mr. Weasley. “Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. “The, er, sitting room, why don’t you use that?” “You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. “There will be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur.” Harry  saw  Mr.  Weasley  exchange  a  worried  look  with  Mrs. Weasley  as  he,  Ron,  and  Hermione  stood  up.  As  they  led  the way  back  to  the  house  in  silence,  Harry  knew  that  the  other  two were  thinking  the  same  as  he  was:  Scrimgeour  must,  somehow, have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. Scrimgeour  did  not  speak  as  they  all  passed  through  the  messy kitchen  and  into  the  Burrow’s  sitting  room.  Although  the  garden had  been  full  of  soft  golden  evening  light,  it  was  already  dark  in here: Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated  the  shabby  but  cozy  room.  Scrimgeour  sat  himself  in the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke. “I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two” — he pointed at Harry and Hermione — “can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.” (cid:145) 122 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE “We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. “You can speak to us together, or not at all.” Scrimgeour  gave  Harry  a  cold,  appraising  look.  Harry  had  the impression that the Minister was wondering whether it was worth-while opening hostilities this early. “Very  well  then,  together,”  he  said,  shrugging.  He  cleared  his throat. “I am here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus Dum-bledore’s will.” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. “A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumble-dore had left you anything?” “A-all of us?” said Ron. “Me and Hermione too?” “Yes, all of —” But Harry interrupted. “Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us?” “Isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could an-swer. “They wanted to examine whatever he’s left us. You had no right to do that!” she said, and her voice trembled slightly. “I had every right,” said Scrimgeour dismissively. “The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will —” “That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,” said  Hermione,  “and  the  Ministry  is  supposed  to  have  powerful evidence  that  the  deceased’s  possessions  are  illegal  before  seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed?” “Are  you  planning  to  follow  a  career  in  Magical  Law,  Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour. (cid:145) 123 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN “No, I’m not,” retorted Hermione. “I’m hoping to do some good in the world!” Ron laughed. Scrimgeour’s eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry spoke. “So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can’t think of a pretext to keep them?” “No, it’ll be because the thirty-one days are up,” said Hermione at once. “They can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they’re dangerous. Right?” “Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?” asked Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled. “Me? Not — not really . . . It was always Harry who . . .” Ron  looked  around  at  Harry  and  Hermione,  to  see  Hermione giving  him  a  stop-talking-now!  sort  of  look,  but  the  damage  was done: Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron’s answer. “If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will? He made exception-ally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions — his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects — were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?” “I . . . dunno,” said Ron. “I . . . when I say we weren’t close . . . I mean, I think he liked me. . . .” “You’re being modest, Ron,” said Hermione. “Dumbledore was very fond of you.” This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had never been alone together, and   (cid:145) 124 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE direct contact between them had been negligible. However, Scrim-geour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud. “ ‘The  Last  Will  and  Testament  of  Albus  Percival  Wulfric  Brian Dumbledore’ . . . Yes, here we are. . . . ‘To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it.’ ” Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen be-fore: It looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Delumi-nator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in his fingers, looking stunned. “That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. “It may even be unique. Certainly  it  is  of  Dumbledore’s  own  design. Why would he have left you an item so rare?” Ron shook his head, looking bewildered. “Dumbledore  must  have  taught  thousands  of  students,”  Scrim-geour persevered. “Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put his Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?” “Put out lights, I s’pose,” mumbled Ron. “What else could I do with it?” Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore’s will. “ ‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of  The Tales   (cid:145) 125 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.’ ” Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was  stained  and  peeling  in  places.  Hermione  took  it  from  Scrim-geour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols. “Why  do  you  think  Dumbledore  left  you  that  book,  Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour. “He . . . he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve. “But why that particular book?” “I don’t know. He must have thought I’d enjoy it.” “Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret mes-sages, with Dumbledore?” “No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. “And if the Ministry hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will.” She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around Hermione’s shoulders. Scrimgeour turned back to the will. “ ‘To Harry James Potter,’ ” he read, and Harry’s insides contracted with a sudden excitement, “ ‘I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perse-verance and skill.’ ” As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax. (cid:145) 126 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE “Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?” asked Scrimgeour. “No idea,” said Harry. “For the reasons you just read out, I sup-pose . . . to remind me what you can get if you . . . persevere and whatever it was.” “You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?” “I suppose so,” said Harry. “What else could it be?” “I’m asking the questions,” said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the mar-quee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge. “I  notice  that  your  birthday  cake  is  in  the  shape  of  a  Snitch,” Scrimgeour said to Harry. “Why is that?” Hermione laughed derisively. “Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact Harry’s a great Seeker, that’s way too obvious,” she said. “There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!” “I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said Scrim-geour, “but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I’m sure?” Harry  shrugged.  Hermione,  however,  answered:  Harry  thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge. “Because Snitches have flesh memories,” she said. “What?” said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermi-one’s Quidditch knowledge negligible. “Correct,” said Scrimgeour. “A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before  it  is  released,  not  even  by  the  maker,  who  wears  gloves.  It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch” — he held up the tiny golden ball — “will remember your touch, Potter. (cid:145) 127 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you.” Harry’s  heart  was  beating  rather  fast.  He  was  sure  that  Scrim-geour was right. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister? “You don’t say anything,” said Scrimgeour. “Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?” “No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the  Snitch  without  really  doing  so.  If  only  he  knew  Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione’s mind; he could practi-cally hear her brain whirring beside him. “Take it,” said Scrimgeour quietly. Harry met the Minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again  and  placed  the  Snitch,  slowly  and  deliberately,  into  Harry’s palm. Nothing happened. As Harry’s fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Her-mione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way. “That was dramatic,” said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermi-one laughed. “That’s all, then, is it?” asked Hermione, making to prise herself off the sofa. “Not  quite,”  said  Scrimgeour,  who  looked  bad-tempered  now. “Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.” “What is it?” asked Harry, excitement rekindling. Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time. (cid:145) 128 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE “The sword of Godric Gryffindor,” he said. Hermione  and  Ron  both  stiffened.  Harry  looked  around  for  a sign  of  the  ruby-encrusted  hilt,  but  Scrimgeour  did  not  pull  the sword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too small to contain it. “So where is it?” Harry asked suspiciously. “Unfortunately,” said Scrimgeour, “that sword was not Dumble-dore’s to give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, belongs —” “It belongs to Harry!” said Hermione hotly. “It chose him, he was the one who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat —” “According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor,” said Scrimgeour. “That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may  have  decided.”  Scrimgeour  scratched  his  badly  shaven  cheek, scrutinizing Harry. “Why do you think — ?” “—  Dumbledore  wanted  to  give  me  the  sword?”  said  Harry, struggling  to  keep  his  temper.  “Maybe  he  thought  it  would  look nice on my wall.” “This is not a joke, Potter!” growled Scrimgeour. “Was it because Dumbledore  believed  that  only  the  sword  of  Godric  Gryffindor could  defeat  the  Heir  of  Slytherin?  Did  he  wish  to  give  you  that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?” “Interesting theory,” said Harry. “Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down Delumina-tors or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So is this what you’ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break open (cid:145) 129 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN a Snitch? People are dying — I was nearly one of them — Volde-mort chased me across three counties, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there’s been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!” “You go too far!” shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped to  his  feet  too.  Scrimgeour  limped  toward  Harry  and  jabbed  him hard  in  the  chest  with  the  point  of  his  wand:  It  singed  a  hole  in Harry’s T-shirt like a lit cigarette. “Oi!” said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said, “No! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?” “Remembered you’re not at school, have you?” said Scrimgeour, breathing hard into Harry’s face. “Remembered that I am not Dum-bledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It’s time you learned some respect!” “It’s time you earned it,” said Harry. The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the sitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in. “We — we thought we heard —” began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtu-ally nose to nose. “— raised voices,” panted Mrs. Weasley. Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had made in Harry’s T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper. “It — it was nothing,” he growled. “I . . . regret your attitude,” he (cid:145) 130 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE said, looking Harry full in the face once more. “You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you — what Dumbledore — desired. We ought to be working together.” “I don’t like your methods, Minister,” said Harry. “Remember?” For  the  second  time,  he  raised  his  right  fist  and  displayed  to Scrimgeour  the  scars  that  still  showed  white  on  the  back  of  it, spelling  I  must  not  tell  lies.  Scrimgeour’s  expression  hardened.  He turned away without another word and limped from the room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so she called, “He’s gone!” “What  did  he  want?”  Mr.  Weasley  asked,  looking  around  at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them. “To give us what Dumbledore left us,” said Harry. “They’ve only just released the contents of his will.” Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour  had  given  them  were  passed  from  hand  to  hand.  Ev-eryone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weas-ley  examined  the  Deluminator  for  the  third  or  fourth  time,  Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, “Harry, dear, everyone’s awfully hungry, we didn’t like to start without you. . . . Shall I serve dinner now?” They  all  ate  rather  hurriedly  and  then,  after  a  hasty  chorus  of “Happy Birthday” and much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field. (cid:145) 131 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN “Meet  us  upstairs,”  Harry  whispered  to  Hermione,  while  they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. “After everyone’s gone to bed.” Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid’s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder’s Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.’s locket. He pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside. “Muffliato,” she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs. nator.” “Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron. “Times  change,”  said  Hermione.  “Now,  show  us  that  Delumi-Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once. “The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.” There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more. “Still,  it’s  cool,”  said  Ron,  a  little  defensively.  “And  from  what they said, Dumbledore invented it himself!” “I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!” “D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he’d left us?” asked Harry. “Definitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . .” (cid:145) 132 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE “. . . why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?” asked Ron. “Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the Bard. “If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us know why . . . unless he thought it was obvious?” “Thought wrong, then, didn’t he?” said Ron. “I always said he was mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch — what the hell was that about?” “I’ve no idea,” said Hermione. “When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!” “Yeah,  well,”  said  Harry,  his  pulse  quickening  as  he  raised  the Snitch  in  his  fingers.  “I  wasn’t  going  to  try  too  hard  in  front  of Scrimgeour, was I?” “What do you mean?” asked Hermione. “The  Snitch  I  caught  in  my  first  ever  Quidditch  match?”  said Harry. “Don’t you remember?” Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, point-ing  frantically  from  Harry  to  the  Snitch  and  back  again  until  he found his voice. “That was the one you nearly swallowed!” “Exactly,” said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch. It  did  not  open.  Frustration  and  bitter  disappointment  welled up inside him: He lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out. “Writing! There’s writing on it, quick, look!” He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Her-mione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, (cid:145) 133 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN where  seconds  before  there  had  been  nothing,  were  five  words written in the thin, slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as Dumbledore’s: I open at the close. He had barely read them when the words vanished again. “ ‘I open at the close . . .’ What’s that supposed to mean?” Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank. “I open at the close . . . at the close . . . I open at the close . . .” But  no  matter  how  often  they  repeated  the  words,  with  many different inflections, they were unable to wring any more meaning from them. “And the sword,” said Ron finally, when they had at last aban-doned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch’s inscription. “Why did he want Harry to have the sword?” “And why couldn’t he just have told me?” Harry said quietly. “It was there, it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn’t he just give it to me then?” He felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a ques-tion he ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there something he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand? “And as for this book,” said Hermione, “The Tales of Beedle the Bard . . . I’ve never even heard of them!” “You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” said Ron incredulously. “You’re kidding, right?”  (cid:145) 134 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WILL  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE “No, I’m not!” said Hermione in surprise. “Do you know them, then?” one? “Well, of course I do!” Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise. “Oh come on! All the old kids’ stories are supposed to be Beedle’s, aren’t they? ‘The Fountain of Fair Fortune’ . . . ‘The Wizard and the Hopping Pot’ . . . ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’ . . .” “Excuse  me?”  said  Hermione,  giggling.  “What  was  that  last “Come off it!” said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Her-mione. “You must’ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty —” “Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!” said Hermione. “We didn’t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and ‘Cinderella’ —” “What’s that, an illness?” asked Ron. “So these are children’s stories?” asked Hermione, bending again over the runes. “Yeah,” said Ron uncertainly, “I mean, that’s just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they’re like in the original versions.” “But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?” Something creaked downstairs. “Probably just Charlie, now Mum’s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair,” said Ron nervously. “All the same, we should get to bed,” whispered Hermione. “It wouldn’t do to oversleep tomorrow.”  (cid:145) 135 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVEN “No,” agreed Ron. “A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s mother  might  put  a  bit  of  a  damper  on  the  wedding.  I’ll  get  the lights.” And  he  clicked  the  Deluminator  once  more  as  Hermione  left the room. (cid:145) 136 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  E I G H T THE WEDDING     T hree o’clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred, and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan  was  to  introduce  Harry  as  “Cousin  Barny”  and  trust  to  the great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him. All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden-jacketed band, and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away un-der a tree; Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. Behind  Harry,  the  entrance  to  the  marquee  revealed  rows  and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. (cid:145) 137 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT The supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden bal-loons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly be-come husband and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fat-ter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer’s day. “When I get married,” said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, “I won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I’ll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it’s all over.” “She  wasn’t  too  bad  this  morning,  considering,”  said  George. “Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves — here they come, look.” Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one, out of no-where at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a proces-sion had formed, which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the  witches’  hats,  while  precious  gems  glittered  from  many  of  the wizards’ cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent. “Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,” said George, cran-ing his neck for a better look. “They’ll need help understanding our English customs, I’ll look after them. . . .” “Not  so  fast,  Your  Holeyness,”  said  Fred,  and  darting  past  the gaggle  of  middle-aged  witches  heading  the  procession,  he  said, “Here — permettez-moi to assister vous,” to a pair of pretty French girls,  who  giggled  and  allowed  him  to  escort  them  inside.  George (cid:145) 138 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley’s old Ministry colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry’s lot. “Wotcher,” said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. “Arthur told us you were the one  with  the  curly  hair.  Sorry  about  last  night,”  she  added  in  a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. “The Ministry’s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might not do you any favors.” “It’s  fine,  I  understand,”  said  Harry,  speaking  more  to  Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away, Harry saw Lupin’s face fall again into lines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred’s directions he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks. While  Mr.  Weasley  repaired  the  damage  and  Hagrid  shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance  to  find  Ron  face-to-face  with  a  most  eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the tex-ture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd  symbol,  rather  like  a  triangular  eye,  glistened  from  a  golden chain around his neck. “Xenophilius Lovegood,” he said, extending a hand to Harry, “my daughter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?” he added to Ron. (cid:145) 139 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT “Yes,” said Ron. “Isn’t she with you?” “She  lingered  in  that  charming  little  garden  to  say  hello  to  the gnomes,  such  a  glorious  infestation!  How  few  wizards  realize  just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes — or, to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.” “Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,” said Ron, “but I think Fred and George taught them those.” He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. “Hello, Harry!” she said. “Er — my name’s Barny,” said Harry, flummoxed. “Oh, have you changed that too?” she asked brightly. “How did you know — ?” “Oh, just your expression,” she said. Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you got over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears. Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had  missed  the  exchange  between  Luna  and  Harry.  Bidding  the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, “Daddy, look — one of the gnomes actually bit me!” “How  wonderful!  Gnome  saliva  is  enormously  beneficial!”  said Mr.  Lovegood,  seizing  Luna’s  outstretched  finger  and  examining the  bleeding  puncture  marks.  “Luna,  my  love,  if  you  should  feel any burgeoning talent today — perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in Mermish — do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!” Ron,  passing  them  in  the  opposite  direction,  let  out  a  loud snort. (cid:145) 140 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING “Ron can laugh,” said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xeno-philius toward their seats, “but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.” “Really?” said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father’s peculiar views. “Are you sure you don’t want to put anything on that bite, though?” “Oh, it’s fine,” said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and  looking  Harry  up  and  down.  “You  look  smart.  I  told  Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.” As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch  clutching  his  arm.  Her  beaky  nose,  red-rimmed  eyes,  and feathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo. “.  .  .  and  your  hair’s  much  too  long,  Ronald,  for  a  moment  I thought  you  were  Ginevra.  Merlin’s  beard,  what  is  Xenophilius Lovegood  wearing?  He  looks  like  an  omelet.  And  who  are  you?” she barked at Harry. “Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.” “Another  Weasley?  You  breed  like  gnomes.  Isn’t  Harry  Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?” “No — he couldn’t come —” “Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I’ve just been instructing the bride on how best  to  wear  my  tiara,”  she  shouted  at  Harry.  “Goblin-made,  you know,  and  been  in  my  family  for  centuries.  She’s  a  good-looking girl, but still — French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I  am  a  hundred  and  seven  and  I  ought  not  to  be  on  my  feet  too long.” (cid:145) 141 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reap-pear for some time: When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The marquee was nearly full now, and for the first time there was no queue outside. “Nightmare, Muriel is,” said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve.  “She  used  to  come  for  Christmas  every  year,  then,  thank God,  she  took  offense  because  Fred  and  George  set  off  a  Dung-bomb under her chair at dinner. Dad always says she’ll have writ-ten them out of her will — like they care, they’re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they’re going. . . . Wow,” he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. “You look great!” “Always the tone of surprise,” said Hermione, though she smiled. She  was  wearing  a  floaty,  lilac-colored  dress  with  matching  high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. “Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn’t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She said, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?’ and then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles.’” “Don’t take it personally, she’s rude to everyone,” said Ron. “Talking about Muriel?” inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred. “Yeah, she’s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at weddings.” “Wasn’t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?” asked Hermione. “Well,  yeah,  he  went  a  bit  odd  toward  the  end,”  conceded George. “But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,” said Fred. “He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run (cid:145) 142 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his —” “Yes,  he  sounds  a  real  charmer,”  said  Hermione,  while  Harry roared with laughter. “Never married, for some reason,” said Ron. “You amaze me,” said Hermione. They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his  invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on Hermione, “You look vunderful.” “Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size. As she scram-bled, blushing, to pick it up, she said, “I didn’t know you were — goodness — it’s lovely to see — how are you?” Ron’s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum’s invitation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, “How come you’re here?” “Fleur invited me,” said Krum, eyebrows raised. Harry,  who  had  no  grudge  against  Krum,  shook  hands;  then, feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron’s vicin-ity, offered to show him his seat. “Your friend is not pleased to see me,” said Krum as they entered the  now  packed  marquee.  “Or  is  he  a  relative?”  he  added  with  a glance at Harry’s red curly hair. “Cousin,”  Harry  muttered,  but  Krum  was  not  really  listening. His  appearance  was  causing  a  stir,  particularly  amongst  the  veela cousins: He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Her-mione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle. (cid:145) 143 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT “Time to sit down,” Fred told Harry, “or we’re going to get run over by the bride.” Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  took  their  seats  in  the  second  row behind Fred and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s ears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to Harry, “Did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard?” Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the gen-eral  murmuring  broken  by  occasional  spurts  of  excited  laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives;  Mrs.  Weasley  was  wearing  a  brand-new  set  of  amethyst-colored robes with a matching hat. A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the mar-quee, both wearing dress robes, with large white roses in their but-tonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons. “Ooooh!” said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. A  great  collective  sigh  issued  from  the  assembled  witches  and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur  gliding,  Monsieur  Delacour  bouncing  and  beaming.  Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and  Gabrielle,  both  wearing  golden  dresses,  looked  even  prettier than  usual,  and  once  Fleur  had  reached  him,  Bill  did  not  look  as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback. “Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice, and with (cid:145) 144 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING a slight shock, Harry saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore’s funeral, now standing in front of Bill and  Fleur.  “We  are  gathered  here  today  to  celebrate  the  union  of two faithful souls . . .” “Yes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,” said Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. “But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.” Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry’s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shin-ing hours from a normal person’s life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. . . . “Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle . . . ?” In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing  quietly  into  scraps  of  lace.  Trumpetlike  sounds  from  the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of  his  own  tablecloth-sized  handkerchiefs.  Hermione  turned  and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears. “. . . then I declare you bonded for life.” The tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round of  applause,  the  golden  balloons  overhead burst: Birds of paradise and  tiny  golden  bells  flew  and  floated  out  of  them,  adding  their songs and chimes to the din. “Ladies  and  gentlemen!”  called  the  tufty-haired  wizard.  “If  you would please stand up!” (cid:145) 145 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The seats on which they had been sitting rose grace-fully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form  a  gleaming  dance  floor;  the  hovering  chairs  grouped  them-selves  around  small,  white-clothed  tables,  which  all  floated  grace-fully back to earth around it, and the golden-jacketed band trooped toward a podium. “Smooth,” said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides,  some  bearing  silver  trays  of  pumpkin  juice,  butterbeer,  and firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches. “We should go and congratulate them!” said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers. “We’ll  have  time  later,”  shrugged  Ron,  snatching  three  butter-beers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. “Hermione, cop hold, let’s grab a table. . . . Not there! Nowhere near Muriel —” Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went: Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone. “All right if we join you?” asked Ron. “Oh yes,” she said happily. “Daddy’s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.” “What is it, a lifetime’s supply of Gurdyroots?” asked Ron. Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry (cid:145) 146 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. The band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Dela-cour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur’s father. “I  like  this  song,”  said  Luna,  swaying  in  time  to  the  waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms. “She’s  great,  isn’t  she?”  said  Ron  admiringly.  “Always  good value.” But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna’s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flus-tered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, “Who is that man in the yellow?” “That’s Xenophilius Lovegood, he’s the father of a friend of ours,” said Ron. His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. “Come and dance,” he added abruptly to Hermione. She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They van-ished together into the growing throng on the dance floor. “Ah,  they  are  together  now?”  asked  Krum,  momentarily distracted. “Er — sort of,” said Harry. “Who are you?” Krum asked. “Barny Weasley.” They shook hands. “You, Barny — you know this man Lovegood vell?” “No, I only met him today. Why?” (cid:145) 147 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophil-ius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. “Because,” said Krum, “if he vos not a guest of Fleur’s, I vould duel him, here and now, for vearing that filthy sign upon his chest.” “Sign?” said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular  eye  was  gleaming  on  his  chest.  “Why?  What’s  wrong with it?” “Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald’s sign.” “Grindelwald . . . the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?” “Exactly.” Krum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, “Grindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course,  he  vos  never  poverful  in  this  country,  they  said  he  feared Dumbledore — and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this” — he pointed a finger at Xenophilius — “this is his symbol, I recognized it at vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ven he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes, thinking to shock, make themselves impressive — until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.” Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophil-ius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna’s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, runelike shape. “Are you — er — quite sure it’s Grindelwald’s — ?” “I am not mistaken,” said Krum coldly. “I valked past that sign for several years, I know it vell.” “Well,  there’s  a  chance,”  said  Harry,  “that  Xenophilius  doesn’t actually know what the symbol means. The Lovegoods are quite . . . (cid:145) 148 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING unusual. He could easily have picked it up somewhere and think it’s a  cross  section  of  the  head  of  a  Crumple-Horned  Snorkack  or something.” “The cross section of a vot?” “Well,  I  don’t  know  what  they  are,  but  apparently  he  and  his daughter go on holiday looking for them. . . .” Harry  felt  he  was  doing  a  bad  job  explaining  Luna  and  her father. “That’s  her,”  he  said,  pointing  at  Luna,  who  was  still  dancing alone, waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges. “Vy is she doing that?” asked Krum. “Probably  trying  to  get  rid  of  a  Wrackspurt,”  said  Harry,  who recognized the symptoms. Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it menacingly on his thigh; sparks flew out of the end. “Gregorovitch!” said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care; the memory had come back to him at the sight of Krum’s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it care-fully before the Triwizard Tournament. “Vot about him?” asked Krum suspiciously. “He’s a wandmaker!” “I know that,” said Krum. “He made your wand! That’s why I thought — Quidditch —” Krum was looking more and more suspicious. “How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?” “I . . . I read it somewhere, I think,” said Harry. “In a — a fan magazine,” he improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified. (cid:145) 149 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT “I  had  not  realized  I  ever  discussed  my  vand  with  fans,”  he said. “So . . . er . . . where is Gregorovitch these days?” Krum looked puzzled. “He retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch vand. They are the best — although I know, of course, that you Britons set much store by Ollivander.” Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a reason: It was surely because of what Harry’s wand had done on the night that Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, some-thing  that  Ollivander  had  not  anticipated  or  understood.  Would Gregorovitch  know  better?  Was  he  truly  more  skilled  than  Olli-vander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not? “This girl is very nice-looking,” Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings.  Krum  was  pointing  at  Ginny,  who  had  just  joined Luna. “She is also a relative of yours?” “Yeah,” said Harry, suddenly irritated, “and she’s seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn’t want to cross him.” Krum grunted. “Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, “is  the  point  of  being  an  international  Quidditch  player  if  all  the good-looking girls are taken?” And he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a pass-ing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but Ron  was  dancing  with  Hermione  out  in  the  middle  of  the  floor. (cid:145) 150 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING Harry  leaned  up  against  one  of  the  golden  pillars  and  watched Ginny,  who  was  now  dancing  with  Fred  and  George’s  friend  Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron. He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was  pretty  sure  that  the  latter  would  not  involve  a  wedding  cake topped  with  two  model  phoenixes  that  took  flight  when  the  cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and more uncontained. Fred and George had long since dis-appeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur’s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid,  and  a  squat  wizard  in  a  purple  porkpie  hat  were  singing “Odo the Hero” in a corner. Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron’s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore’s obituary. Harry approached him. “May I sit down?” “Of course, of course,” said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice. Harry leaned in. “Mr. Doge, I’m Harry Potter.” Doge gasped. (cid:145) 151 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT “My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. . . . I am so glad, so honored!” In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne. “I thought of writing to you,” he whispered, “after Dumbledore . . . the shock . . . and for you, I am sure . . .” Doge’s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears. “I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,’’ said Harry. “I didn’t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.” “As well as anyone,” said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. “Certainly I knew him longest, if you don’t count Aberforth — and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.” “Speaking  of  the  Daily  Prophet  .  .  .  I  don’t  know  whether  you saw, Mr. Doge — ?” “Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.” “Elphias, I don’t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?” Doge’s face flooded with angry color. “Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her. I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast upon my sanity.” “Well,  in  that  interview,”  Harry  went  on,  “Rita  Skeeter  hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.” “Don’t believe a word of it!” said Doge at once. “Not a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore!” Harry looked into Doge’s earnest, pained face and felt, not reas-sured, but frustrated. Did Doge really  think  it  was  that  easy,  that (cid:145) 152 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn’t Doge understand Harry’s need to be sure, to know everything? Perhaps Doge suspected Harry’s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, “Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful —” But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle. “Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!” Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hat, a goblet of champagne in her hand. “She’s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!” “Hello, Muriel,” said Doge. “Yes, we were just discussing —” “You there! Give me your chair, I’m a hundred and seven!” Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, look-ing  alarmed,  and  Auntie  Muriel  swung  it  around  with  surprising strength  and  plopped  herself  down  upon  it  between  Doge  and Harry. “Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,” she said to Harry. “Now, what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know she’s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can’t wait to read it, I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!” Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a re-placement. She took another large gulp of champagne, belched, and then said, “There’s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!” “Ill-informed  sniping,”  said  Doge,  turning  radish-colored again. “You would say that, Elphias,” cackled Auntie Muriel. “I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!” (cid:145) 153 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT “I’m sorry you think so,” said Doge, more coldly still. “I assure you I was writing from the heart.” “Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you’ll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!” “Muriel !” exclaimed Doge. A  chill  that  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  iced  champagne  was stealing through Harry’s chest. “What do you mean?” he asked Muriel. “Who said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was ill?” “Thought wrong, then, didn’t you, Barry!” said Auntie Muriel, looking  delighted  at  the  effect  she  had  produced.  “Anyway,  how could you expect to know anything about it? It all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really hap-pened. That’s why I can’t wait to find out what Skeeter’s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!” “Untrue!” wheezed Doge. “Absolutely untrue!” “He never told me his sister was a Squib,” said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside. “And why on earth would he tell you?” screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry. “The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,” began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, “is, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death —” “Why  did  nobody  ever  see  her,  Elphias?”  squawked  Muriel. “Why did half of us never even know she existed, until they car-ried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being (cid:145) 154 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING brilliant  at  Hogwarts,  and  never  mind  what  was  going  on  in  his own house!” “What d’you mean, locked in the cellar?” asked Harry. “What is this?” Doge  looked  wretched.  Auntie  Muriel  cackled  again  and  an-swered Harry. “Dumbledore’s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise —” “She  never  pretended  anything  of  the  sort!  Kendra  was  a  fine woman,”  whispered  Doge  miserably,  but  Auntie  Muriel  ignored him. “— proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a Squib —” “Ariana was not a Squib!” wheezed Doge. “So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!” said Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. “In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, though to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn’t exist —” “I  tell  you,  that’s  not  what  happened!”  said  Doge,  but  Auntie Muriel steamrollered on, still addressing Harry. “Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encour-aged to integrate into the Muggle community . . . much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second class; but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn’t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school —” “Ariana  was  delicate!”  said  Doge  desperately.  “Her  health  was always too poor to permit her —” “— to permit her to leave the house?” cackled Muriel. “And yet (cid:145) 155 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT she was never taken to St. Mungo’s and no Healer was ever sum-moned to see her!” “Really, Muriel, how you can possibly know whether —” “For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo’s at the time, and he told my family in strictest con-fidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought!” Doge  looked  to  be  on  the  verge  of  tears.  Auntie  Muriel,  who seemed  to  be  enjoying  herself  hugely,  snapped  her  fingers  for more champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore’s sister suffered the same  fate  in  reverse:  imprisoned  for  her  lack  of  magic?  And  had Dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts, to prove himself brilliant and talented? “Now,  if  Kendra  hadn’t  died  first,”  Muriel  resumed,  “I’d  have said that it was she who finished off Ariana —” “How can you, Muriel?” groaned Doge. “A mother kill her own daughter? Think what you are saying!” “If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daugh-ter for years on end, why not?” shrugged Auntie Muriel. “But as I say, it doesn’t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana — of what, nobody ever seemed sure —” “Oh,  no  doubt  Ariana  murdered  her,”  said  Doge  with  a  brave attempt at scorn. “Why not?” “Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed  Kendra  in  the  struggle,”  said  Auntie  Muriel  thoughtfully. “Shake your head all you like, Elphias! You were at Ariana’s funeral, were you not?” (cid:145) 156 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING “Yes I was,” said Doge, through trembling lips. “And a more desper-ately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken —” “His heart wasn’t the only thing. Didn’t Aberforth break Albus’s nose halfway through the service?” If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin. “How do you — ?” croaked Doge. “My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,” said Auntie Muriel happily. “Bathilda described the whole thing to Mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda told  it,  Aberforth  shouted  that  it  was  all  Albus’s  fault  that  Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that’s odd enough in itself, Albus  could  have  destroyed  Aberforth  in  a  duel  with  both  hands tied behind his back.” Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of these old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe: He wanted the truth, and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been  ill.  Harry  could  hardly  believe  that  Dumbledore  would  not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story. “And I’ll tell you something else,” Muriel said, hiccuping slightly as she lowered her goblet. “I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter’s interview about an impor-tant source close to the Dumbledores — goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would fit!” “Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge. (cid:145) 157 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHT “Bathilda  Bagshot?”  Harry  said.  “The  author  of  A  History  of  Magic?” The  name  was  printed  on  the  front  of  one  of  Harry’s  text-books,  though  admittedly  not  one  of  the  ones  he  had  read  most attentively. “Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drown-ing man at a life belt. “A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus’s.” “Quite  gaga  these  days,  I’ve  heard,”  said  Auntie  Muriel  cheer-fully. “If  that  is  so,  it  is  even  more  dishonorable  for  Skeeter  to  have taken advantage of her,” said Doge, “and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!” “Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I’m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,” said Auntie Muriel. “But even if Bathilda’s completely cuckoo, I’m sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. . . . Well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought.” Harry, who had been taking a sip  of  butterbeer,  choked.  Doge banged him on the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Mu-riel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, he asked, “Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?” “Oh yes, she’s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.” “The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow?” “Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,” said Auntie Muriel testily. Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dum-bledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in  Godric’s  Hollow.  Why?  Were  Lily  and  James  buried  close  to (cid:145) 158 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WEDDING Dumbledore’s  mother  and  sister?  Had  Dumbledore  visited  their graves, perhaps walked past Lily’s and James’s to do so? And he had never once told Harry . . . never bothered to say . . . And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common. He stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him. “I simply can’t dance anymore,” she panted, slipping off one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. “Ron’s gone looking to find more butterbeers. It’s a bit odd, I’ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna’s father, it looked like they’d been arguing —” She dropped her voice, staring at him. “Harry, are you okay?” Harry  did  not  know  where  to  begin,  but  it  did  not  matter.  At that moment, something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly  in  the  middle  of  the  astonished  dancers.  Heads  turned,  as those  nearest  it  froze  absurdly  in  mid-dance.  Then  the  Patronus’s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt. “The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.” (cid:145) 159 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  N I N E A PLACE TO HIDE     E verything  seemed  fuzzy,  slow.  Harry  and  Hermione  jumped to  their  feet  and  drew  their  wands.  Many  people  were  only just realizing that something strange had happened; heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. Silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed. Then somebody screamed. Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests  were  sprinting  in  all  directions;  many  were  Disapparating; the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken. “Ron!” Hermione cried. “Ron, where are you?” As  they  pushed  their  way  across  the  dance  floor,  Harry  saw cloaked  and  masked  figures  appearing  in  the  crowd;  then  he  saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them shout, “Protego!”, a cry that was echoed on all sides — “Ron!  Ron!”  Hermione  called,  half  sobbing  as  she  and  Harry were  buffeted  by  terrified  guests:  Harry  seized  her  hand  to  make (cid:145) 160 (cid:145) \\x0cA  PLACE TO HIDE sure  they  weren’t  separated  as  a  streak  of  light  whizzed  over  their heads,  whether  a  protective  charm  or  something  more  sinister  he did not know — And  then  Ron  was  there.  He  caught  hold  of  Hermione’s  free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were ex-tinguished  as  darkness  pressed  in  upon  him;  all  he  could  feel  was Hermione’s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away from  the  Burrow,  away  from  the  descending  Death  Eaters,  away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself. . . . “Where are we?” said Ron’s voice. Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left  the  wedding  after  all:  They  still  seemed  to  be  surrounded  by people. “Tottenham Court Road,” panted Hermione. “Walk, just walk, we need to find somewhere for you to change.” Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street thronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes. “Hermione, we haven’t got anything to change into,” Ron told her, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him. “Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?” said Harry, inwardly cursing his own stupidity. “All last year I kept it on me and —” “It’s okay, I’ve got the Cloak, I’ve got clothes for both of you,” said Hermione. “Just try and act naturally until — this will do.” She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shad-owy alleyway. (cid:145) 161 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINE “When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes . . .” said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging. “Yes, they’re here,” said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron’s ut-ter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak. “How the ruddy hell — ?” “Undetectable Extension Charm,” said Hermione. “Tricky, but I think I’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.” She gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. “Oh, damn, that’ll be the books,” she said, peering into it, “and I had them all stacked by subject. . . . Oh well. . . . Harry, you’d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change. . . .” “When did you do all this?” Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes. “I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for days, you  know,  in  case  we  needed  to  make  a  quick  getaway.  I  packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and put it in here. . . . I just had a feeling. . . .” “You’re amazing, you are,” said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes. “Thank  you,”  said  Hermione,  managing  a  small  smile  as  she pushed the robes into the bag. “Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!” Harry  threw  the  Invisibility  Cloak  around  his  shoulders  and pulled it up over his head, vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened. “The others — everyone at the wedding —”  (cid:145) 162 (cid:145) \\x0cA  PLACE TO HIDE “We can’t worry about that now,” whispered Hermione. “It’s you they’re after, Harry, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.” “She’s  right,”  said  Ron,  who  seemed  to  know  that  Harry  was about to argue, even if he could not see his face. “Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after everyone.” Harry  nodded,  then  remembered  that  they  could  not  see  him, and said, “Yeah.” But he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach. “Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,” said Hermione. They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement. “Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?” Ron asked Hermione. “I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m sure we’re safer out in the Muggle world, it’s not where they’ll expect us to be.” “True,”  said  Ron,  looking  around,  “but  don’t  you  feel  a  bit — exposed?” “Where else is there?” asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the  other  side  of  the  road  started  wolf-whistling  at  her.  “We  can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try my parents’  house,  though  I  think  there’s  a  chance  they  might  check there. . . . Oh, I wish they’d shut up!” “All right, darling?” the drunkest of the men on the other pave-ment was yelling. “Fancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and have a pint!”  (cid:145) 163 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINE “Let’s sit down somewhere,” Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his  mouth  to  shout  back  across  the  road.  “Look,  this  will  do,  in here!” It was a small and shabby all-night café. A light layer of grease lay  on  all  the  Formica-topped  tables,  but  it  was  at  least  empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. Harry did not like being stationary; walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him,  his  hands  returning  to  their usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again. After a minute or two, Ron said, “You know, we’re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing Cross —” “Ron, we can’t!” said Hermione at once. “Not to stay there, but to find out what’s going on!” “We know what’s going on! Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to know?” “Okay, okay, it was just an idea!” They relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress shuffled  over  and  Hermione  ordered  two  cappuccinos:  As  Harry was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the café and squeezed into the next booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper. “I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the coun-tryside. Once we’re there, we could send a message to the Order.” “Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?” asked Ron. “I’ve been practicing and I think so,” said Hermione. (cid:145) 164 (cid:145) \\x0cA  PLACE TO HIDE “Well, as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble, though they might’ve  been  arrested  already.  God,  that’s  revolting,”  Ron  added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new cus-tomers’ orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She stared, affronted. “Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this muck,” said Ron. “Hermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?” “Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. I’ll bet all the change is at the bottom,” sighed Hermi-one, reaching for her beaded bag. The  two  workmen  made  identical  movements,  and  Harry  mir-rored  them  without  conscious  thought:  All  three  of  them  drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on,  lunged  across  the  table,  pushing  Hermione  sideways  onto  her bench. The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the tiled wall where  Ron’s  head  had  just  been,  as  Harry,  still  invisible,  yelled, “Stupefy!” The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light:  He  slumped  sideways,  unconscious.  His  companion,  unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot — the waitress screamed and ran for the door — Harry sent another Stun-ning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door. “Expulso!” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up: The  force of the explosion slammed (cid:145) 165 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINE him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him. “Petrificus Totalus!” screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over. “D-diffindo,” she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. “Oh, I’m so sorry, Ron, my hand’s shaking! Diffindo!” The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench. “I should’ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,” he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man’s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “That’s Dolohov,” said Ron. “I recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one’s Thorfinn Rowle.” “Never mind what they’re called!” said Hermione a little hysteri-cally. “How did they find us? What are we going to do?” Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry’s head. “Lock the door,” he told her, “and Ron, turn out the lights.” He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the café into darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance. “What are we going to do with them?” Ron whispered to Harry   (cid:145) 166 (cid:145) \\x0cA  PLACE TO HIDE through the dark; then, even more quietly, “Kill them? They’d kill us. They had a good go just now.” Hermione  shuddered  and  took  a  step  backward.  Harry  shook his head. “We just need to wipe their memories,” said Harry. “It’s better like  that,  it’ll  throw  them  off  the  scent.  If  we  killed  them  it’d  be obvious we were here.” “You’re the boss,” said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. “But I’ve never done a Memory Charm.” “Nor have I,” said Hermione, “but I know the theory.” She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolo-hov’s forehead and said, “Obliviate.” At once, Dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and dreamy. “Brilliant!” said Harry, clapping her on the back. “Take care of the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.” “Clear  up?”  said  Ron,  looking  around  at  the  partly  destroyed café. “Why?” “Don’t  you  think  they  might  wonder  what’s  happened  if  they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it’s just been bombed?” “Oh right, yeah . . .” Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket. “It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they’re tight.” “Oh,  I’m  so  sorry,”  hissed  Hermione,  and  as  she  dragged  the waitress out of sight of the windows, Harry heard her mutter a sug-gestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead.  (cid:145) 167 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINE Once the café was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters back into their booth and propped them up fac-ing each other. “But how did they find us?” Hermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. “How did they know where we were?” She turned to Harry. “You — you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?” “He can’t have,” said Ron. “The Trace breaks at seventeen, that’s Wizarding law, you can’t put it on an adult.” “As far as you know,” said Hermione. “What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?” “But Harry hasn’t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who’s supposed to have put a Trace back on him?” Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was that really how the Death Eaters had found them? “If I can’t use magic, and you can’t use magic near me, without us giving away our position —” he began. “We’re not splitting up!” said Hermione firmly. “We need a safe place to hide,” said Ron. “Give us time to think things through.” “Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. The other two gaped. “Don’t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!” “Ron’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him — and even if they haven’t worked,” he pressed on as Hermione began to argue, “so what? I swear, I’d like nothing better than to meet Snape!” “But —” “Hermione,  where  else  is  there?  It’s  the  best  chance  we’ve  got. (cid:145) 168 (cid:145) \\x0cA  PLACE TO HIDE Snape’s only one Death Eater. If I’ve still got the Trace on me, we’ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.” She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she unlocked the café door, Ron clicked the Delumina-tor to release the café’s light. Then, on Harry’s count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more. Seconds  later  Harry’s  lungs  expanded  gratefully  and  he  opened his eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking every few yards that they were not be-ing followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the front door once with his wand. They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold. As  Harry  closed  the  door  behind  them,  the  old-fashioned  gas lamps sprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shad-ows  up  the  staircase.  Long  dark  curtains  concealed  the portrait of Sirius’s mother. The only thing that was out of place was the troll’s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over again. “I think somebody’s been in here,” Hermione whispered, point-ing toward it. (cid:145) 169 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINE “That  could’ve  happened  as  the  Order  left,”  Ron  murmured “So  where  are  these  jinxes  they  put  up  against  Snape?”  Harry back. asked. “Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested Ron. Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared to move farther into the house. “Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he took a step forward. “Severus Snape?” Mad-Eye Moody’s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them jump back in fright. “We’re not Snape!” croaked Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue  curled  backward  on  itself,  making  it  impossible  to  speak. Before  he  had  time  to  feel  inside  his  mouth,  however,  his  tongue had unraveled again. The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered, “That m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!” Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored,  and  terrible:  Hermione  screamed  and  so  did  Mrs.  Black, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry.  (cid:145) 170 (cid:145) \\x0cA  PLACE TO HIDE “No!” Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. “No! It wasn’t us! We didn’t kill you —” On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, his eyes watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying, “It’s all r-right. . . . It’s g-gone. . . .” Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black continued to scream. “Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of  my fathers —” “SHUT  UP!”  Harry  bellowed,  directing  his  wand  at  her,  and with  a  bang  and  a  burst  of  red  sparks,  the  curtains  swung  shut again, silencing her. “That . . . that was . . .” Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. “Yeah,” said Harry, “but it wasn’t really him, was it? Just some-thing to scare Snape.” Had  it  worked,  Harry  wondered,  or  had  Snape  already  blasted the horror-figure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumble-dore?  Nerves  still  tingling,  he  led  the  other  two  up  the  hall,  half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board. “Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,” whispered Hermione, and she raised her wand and said, “Homenum revelio.” Nothing happened. “Well, you’ve just had a big shock,” said Ron kindly. “What was that supposed to do?”  (cid:145) 171 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINE “It  did  what  I  meant  it  to  do!”  said  Hermione  rather  crossly. “That  was  a  spell  to  reveal  human  presence,  and  there’s  nobody here except us!” “And old Dusty,” said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-figure had risen. “Let’s go up,” said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. Hermione  waved  her  wand  to  ignite  the  old  gas  lamps,  then, shivering slightly in the drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtain aside an inch. “Can’t see anyone out there,” he reported. “And you’d think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, they’d have followed us here. I know they can’t get in the house, but — what’s up, Harry?” Harry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned again as some-thing flashed across his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock. “What did you see?” Ron asked, advancing on Harry. “Did you see him at my place?” “No, I just felt anger — he’s really angry —” “But that could be at the Burrow,” said Ron loudly. “What else? Didn’t you see anything? Was he cursing someone?” “No, I just felt anger — I couldn’t tell —” Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice, “Your scar, again? But what’s going on? I thought that connection had closed!” “It did, for a while,” muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, (cid:145) 172 (cid:145) \\x0cA  PLACE TO HIDE which made it hard to concentrate. “I — I think it’s started opening again whenever he loses control, that’s how it used to —” “But then you’ve got to close your mind!” said Hermione shrilly. “Harry,  Dumbledore  didn’t  want  you  to  use  that  connection,  he wanted you to shut it down, that’s why you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember —” “Yeah, I do remember, thanks,” said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius’s death. He wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threaten-ing,  as  though  he  were  pressing  against  the  window  of  the  room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick. He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to exam-ine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Her-mione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron’s father. “Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.” The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise be-tween a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm. “They’re all right, they’re all right!” she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her. “Harry,” he said over Hermione’s shoulder, “I —” “It’s not a problem,” said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. (cid:145) 173 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINE “It’s your family, ’course you’re worried. I’d feel the same way.” He thought of Ginny. “I do feel the same way.” The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had done in the garden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say, “I don’t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I’ve brought and camp in here tonight?” He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer: He had to succumb. “Bathroom,” he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running. He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the great blond  Death  Eater  on  the  floor,  screaming  and  writhing,  and  a slighter  figure  standing  over  him,  wand  outstretched,  while  Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice. “More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time. . . . You called me  back  for  this,  to  tell  me  that  Harry  Potter  has  escaped  again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. . . . Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!” A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face — with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes. He  was  spread-eagled  on  the  cold  black  marble  floor,  his  nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy’s gaunt, petrified face seemed branded   (cid:145) 174 (cid:145) \\x0cA  PLACE TO HIDE on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort. There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermi-one’s voice rang out. “Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I’ve got it here.” “Yeah, great, thanks,” he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in. (cid:145) 175 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T E N KREACHER’S TALE    H arry  woke  early  next  morning,  wrapped  in  a  sleeping bag on the drawing room floor. A chink of sky was vis-ible between the heavy curtains: It was the cool, clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for Ron and Hermione’s slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over  at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron’s. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely. He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chande-lier. Less than twenty-four hours ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee,  waiting  to  show  in  wed-ding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen now? He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the (cid:145) 176 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE daunting, complex mission Dumbledore had left him. . . . Dumble-dore . . . The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore’s death felt different  now.  The  accusations  he  had  heard  from  Muriel  at  the wedding  seemed  to  have  nested  in  his  brain  like  diseased  things, infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could Dum-bledore  have  let  such  things  happen?  Had  he  been  like  Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being impris-oned and hidden? Harry  thought  of  Godric’s  Hollow,  of  graves  Dumbledore  had never mentioned there; he thought of mysterious objects left with-out  explanation  in  Dumbledore’s  will,  and  resentment  swelled  in the  darkness.  Why  hadn’t  Dumbledore  told  him?  Why  hadn’t  he explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in? Harry  could  not  stand  lying  there  with  nothing  but  bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distrac-tion,  he  slipped  out  of  his  sleeping  bag,  picked  up  his  wand,  and crept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, “Lumos,” and started to climb the stairs by wandlight. On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time they had been here; he glanced into it. The ward-robe  doors  stood  open  and  the  bedclothes  had  been  ripped  back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and  after  Sirius  died?  Harry’s  gaze  wandered  to  the  portrait  that (cid:145) 177 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN sometimes  contained  Phineas  Nigellus  Black,  Sirius’s  great-great-grandfather,  but  it  was  empty,  showing  nothing  but  a  stretch  of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmaster’s study at Hogwarts. Harry  continued  up  the  stairs  until  he  reached  the  topmost landing,  where  there  were  only  two  doors.  The  one  facing  him bore  a  nameplate  reading  Sirius.  Harry  had  never  entered  his godfather’s  bedroom  before.  He  pushed  open  the  door,  holding his  wand  high  to  cast  light  as  widely  as  possible.  The  room  was spacious  and  must  once  have  been  handsome.  There  was  a  large bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by  long  velvet  curtains,  and  a  chandelier  thickly  coated  in  dust with candle stubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging in  frostlike  drips.  A  fine  film  of  dust  covered  the  pictures  on  the walls  and  the  bed’s  headboard;  a  spider’s  web  stretched  between the  chandelier  and  the  top  of  the  large  wooden  wardrobe,  and  as Harry  moved  deeper  into  the  room,  he  heard  a  scurrying  of  dis-turbed mice. The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many post-ers and pictures that little of the walls’ silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry  could  only  assume  that  Sirius’s parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall, because  he  was  sure  they  would  not  have  appreciated  their  eldest son’s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have gone out of his way to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and gold, just to underline his difference from all the rest  of  the  Slytherin  family.  There  were  many  pictures  of  Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several   (cid:145) 178 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; Harry could tell that they were Muggles  because  they  remained  quite  stationary  within  their  pic-tures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in contrast to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls, which was a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera. With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father; his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like Harry’s, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius’s right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. On James’s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked and included . . . or was it simply because Harry knew how it had been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room. Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was grow-ing  brighter:  A  shaft  of  light  revealed  bits  of  paper,  books,  and small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius’s bedroom had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been judged  mostly,  if  not  entirely,  worthless.  A  few  of  the  books  had been  shaken  roughly  enough  to  part  company  with  their  covers, and sundry pages littered the floor. Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and   (cid:145) 179 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN examined them. He recognized one as part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as belonging to  a  motorcycle  maintenance  manual.  The  third  was  handwritten and crumpled. He smoothed it out.  Dear Padfoot, Thank you, thank you, for Harry’s birthday present! It was his favorite by far. One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself, I’m enclosing a picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground, but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course, James thought it was so funny, says he’s going to be a great Quidditch player, but we’ve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don’t take our eyes off him when he gets going. We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s got to come first, and Harry’s not old enough to know it’s his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell — also, Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy was here last weekend, I thought he seemed down, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; I cried all evening when I heard. Bathilda drops in most days, she’s a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore, I’m not (cid:145) 180 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE sure he’d be pleased if he knew! I don’t know how much to believe, actually, because it seems incredible that Dumbledore  Harry’s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite still,  holding  the  miraculous  paper  in  his  nerveless  fingers  while inside him a kind of quiet eruption sent joy and grief thundering in  equal  measure  through  his  veins.  Lurching  to  the  bed,  he  sat down. He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time, and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. She had made her “g”s the same way he did: He searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil. The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, really lived, that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment, tracing ink into these letters, these words, words about him, Harry, her son. Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time concentrating on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered voice. They had had a cat . . . perhaps it had perished, like his parents, at Godric’s Hollow . . . or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it. . . . Sirius had bought him his first broomstick. . . . His parents had  known  Bathilda  Bagshot;  had  Dumbledore  introduced  them? Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak . . . There was something funny there. . . . Harry  paused,  pondering  his  mother’s  words.  Why  had  Dum-bledore  taken  James’s  Invisibility  Cloak?  Harry  distinctly  remem-bered his headmaster telling him years before, “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible.” Perhaps some less gifted Order member had (cid:145) 181 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN needed its assistance, and Dumbledore had acted as carrier? Harry passed on. . . . Wormy was here . . . Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed “down,” had he? Was he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time? And  finally  Bathilda  again,  who  told  incredible  stories  about Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore — That  Dumbledore  what?  But  there  were  any  number  of  things that  would  seem  incredible  about  Dumbledore;  that  he  had  once received  bottom  marks  in  a  Transfiguration  test,  for  instance,  or had taken up goat-charming like Aberforth. . . . Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere. He seized papers, treating them, in his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher; he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair. At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph Lily had described in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the pic-ture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing after him. Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily’s letter and continued to look for the second sheet. After  another  quarter  of  an  hour,  however,  he  was  forced  to conclude that the rest of his mother’s letter was gone. Had it sim-ply  been  lost  in  the  sixteen  years  that  had  elapsed  since  it  had been  written,  or  had  it  been  taken  by  whoever  had  searched  the (cid:145) 182 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE room? Harry read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues as  to  what  might  have  made  the  second  sheet  valuable.  His  toy broomstick  could  hardly  be  considered  interesting  to  the  Death Eaters.  .  .  .  The  only  potentially  useful  thing  he  could  see  here was  possible  information  on  Dumbledore.  It  seems  incredible  that Dumbledore — what? “Harry? Harry! Harry!” “I’m here!” he called. “What’s happened?” There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst inside. “We woke up and didn’t know where you were!” she said breath-lessly. She turned and shouted over her shoulder, “Ron! I’ve found him!” Ron’s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below. “Good! Tell him from me he’s a git!” “Harry, don’t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did you come up here anyway?” She gazed around the ransacked room. “What have you been doing?” “Look what I’ve just found.” He  held  out  his  mother’s  letter.  Hermione  took  it  and  read  it while Harry watched her. When she reached the end of the page she looked up at him. “Oh, Harry . . .” “And there’s this too.” He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom. “I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” Harry said, “but it’s not here.” Hermione glanced around. (cid:145) 183 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN “Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?” “Someone had searched before me,” said Harry. “I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. What were they after, do you think?” “Information on the Order, if it was Snape.” “But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was in the Order, wasn’t he?” “Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about information  on  Dumbledore?  The  second  page  of  this  letter,  for instance.  You  know  this  Bathilda  my  mum  mentions,  you  know who she is?” “Who?” “Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —” “A History of Magic,” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents knew her? She was an incredible magical historian.” “And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in Godric’s Hol-low,  Ron’s  Auntie  Muriel  was  talking  about  her  at  the  wedding. She  knew  Dumbledore’s  family  too.  Be  pretty  interesting  to  talk to, wouldn’t she?” There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermi-one  gave  him  for  Harry’s  liking.  He  took  back  the  letter  and  the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at her and give himself away. “I understand why you’d love to talk to her about your mum and dad, and Dumbledore too,” said Hermione. “But that wouldn’t re-ally help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?” Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, “Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric’s Hollow, but I’m scared, I’m scared at how easily those (cid:145) 184 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I’m sure they’d be expecting you to visit it.” “It’s not just that,” Harry said, still avoiding looking at her. “Mur-iel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth. . . .” He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he  had  finished,  Hermione  said,  “Of  course,  I  can  see  why  that’s upset you, Harry —” “I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not it’s true or —” “Harry, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dumbledore!” “I thought I did,” he muttered. “But  you  know  how  much  truth  there  was  in  everything  Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?” He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it  was  again:  Choose  what  to  believe.  He  wanted  the  truth.  Why was everybody so determined that he should not get it? “Shall we go down to the kitchen?” Hermione suggested after a little pause. “Find something for breakfast?” He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the land-ing and past the second door that led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not noticed in the dark. He paused at the top of the stairs to read it. It was a pompous little sign, neatly lettered by hand, the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door: (cid:145) 185 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN Do Not Enter Without the Express Permission of Regulus Arcturus Black Excitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately sure why. He read the sign again. Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him. “Hermione,” he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm. “Come back up here.” “What’s the matter?” “R.A.B. I think I’ve found him.” There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs. “In your mum’s letter? But I didn’t see —” Harry shook his head, pointing at Regulus’s sign. She read it, then clutched Harry’s arm so tightly that he winced. “Sirius’s brother?” she whispered. “He was a Death Eater,” said Harry, “Sirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they killed him.” “That fits!” gasped Hermione. “If he was a Death Eater he had access to Voldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down!” She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, “Ron! RON! Get up here, quick!” Ron  appeared,  panting,  a  minute  later,  his  wand  ready  in  his hand. “What’s  up?  If  it’s  massive  spiders  again  I  want  breakfast before I —”  (cid:145) 186 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE He frowned at the sign on Regulus’s door, to which Hermione was silently pointing. “What? That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it? Regulus Arcturus . . . Regulus . . . R.A.B.! The locket — you don’t reckon — ?” “Let’s find out,” said Harry. He pushed the door: It was locked. Hermione  pointed  her  wand  at  the  handle  and  said,  “Alohomora.” There was a click, and the door swung open. They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus’s bedroom was slightly smaller than Sirius’s, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his  difference  from  the  rest  of  the  family,  Regulus  had  striven  to emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, and the windows. The Black  family  crest  was  painstakingly  painted  over  the  bed,  along with  its  motto,  Toujours  Pur.  Beneath  this  was  a  collection  of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a ragged col-lage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them. “They’re all about Voldemort,” she said. “Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters. . . .” A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photo-graph; a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their  chests:  Slytherins.  Regulus  was  instantly  recognizable  as  the boy sitting in the middle of the front row: He had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been. “He played Seeker,” said Harry.  (cid:145) 187 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN “What?” said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Vol-demort’s press clippings. “He’s  sitting  in  the  middle  of  the  front  row,  that’s  where  the Seeker  .  .  .  Never  mind,”  said  Harry,  realizing  that  nobody  was listening:  Ron  was  on  his  hands  and  knees,  searching  under  the wardrobe.  Harry  looked  around  the  room  for  likely  hiding  places and approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had searched before them.  The  drawers’  contents  had  been  turned  over  recently,  the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there: old quills, out-of-date  textbooks  that  bore  evidence  of  being  roughly  handled,  a recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer. “There’s an easier way,” said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans. She raised her wand and said, “Accio Locket!” Nothing  happened.  Ron,  who  had  been  searching  the  folds  of the faded curtains, looked disappointed. “Is that it, then? It’s not here?” “Oh,  it  could  still  be  here,  but  under  counter-enchantments,” said Hermione. “Charms to prevent it being summoned magically, you know.” “Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,” said Harry, re-membering how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket. “How are we supposed to find it then?” asked Ron. “We search manually,” said Hermione. “That’s a good idea,” said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his examination of the curtains. They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were forced, finally, to conclude that the locket was not there.  (cid:145) 188 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows. “It could be somewhere else in the house, though,” said Hermi-one  in  a  rallying  tone  as  they  walked  back  downstairs:  As  Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, she seemed to have become more determined. “Whether he’d managed to destroy it or not, he’d want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldn’t he? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them there to protect the locket’s hiding place, even though we didn’t realize it at . . . at . . .” Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in midair, with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been Oblivi-ated; her eyes had even drifted out of focus. “. . . at the time,” she finished in a whisper. “Something wrong?” asked Ron. “There was a locket.” “What?” said Harry and Ron together. “In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we . . . we . . .” Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his  stomach.  He  remembered:  He  had  even  handled  the  thing  as they passed it around, each trying in turn to prise it open. It had been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wart-cap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy. . . . “Kreacher  nicked  loads  of  things  back  from  us,”  said  Harry.  It was the only chance, the only slender hope left to them, and he was   (cid:145) 189 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN going to cling to it until forced to let go. “He had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C’mon.” He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along in his wake. They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Sirius’s mother as they passed through the hall. “Filth! Mudbloods! Scum!” she screamed after them as they dashed down  into  the  basement  kitchen  and  slammed  the  door  behind them. Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at the door of Kreacher’s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the nest of  dirty  old  blankets  in  which  the  house-elf  had  once  slept,  but they  were  no  longer  glittering  with  the  trinkets  Kreacher  had  sal-vaged. The only thing there was an old copy of Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally  across  the  floor.  Ron  groaned  as  he  threw  himself  into  a kitchen chair; Hermione closed her eyes. “It’s not over yet,” said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, “Kreacher!” There was a loud crack and the house-elf that Harry had so re-luctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half human-sized, his pale skin hanging off him in folds, white hair  sprouting  copiously  from  his batlike ears. He was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first  met  him,  and  the  contemptuous  look  he  bent  upon  Harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit. “Master,” croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog’s voice, and he bowed   (cid:145) 190 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE low, muttering to his knees, “back in my Mistress’s old house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood —” “I  forbid  you  to  call  anyone  ‘blood  traitor’  or  ‘Mudblood,’ ” growled Harry. He would have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctly unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort. “I’ve got a question for you,” said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf, “and I order you to answer it truth-fully. Understand?” “Yes,  Master,”  said  Kreacher,  bowing  low  again:  Harry  saw  his lips  moving  soundlessly,  undoubtedly  framing  the  insults  he  was now forbidden to utter. “Two years ago,” said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs, “there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back?” There was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher straight-ened up to look Harry full in the face. Then he said, “Yes.” “Where is it now?” asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful. reactions to his next word. Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their “Gone.” “Gone?”  echoed  Harry,  elation  flooding out of him.  “What  do you mean, it’s gone?” The elf shivered. He swayed. “Kreacher,” said Harry fiercely, “I order you —” “Mundungus Fletcher,” croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. “Mundungus Fletcher stole it all: Miss Bella’s and Miss Cissy’s   (cid:145) 191 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN pictures, my Mistress’s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the family crest, and — and —” Kreacher  was  gulping  for  air:  His  hollow  chest  was  rising  and falling rapidly, then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcur-dling scream. “—  and  the  locket,  Master  Regulus’s  locket,  Kreacher  did  wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!” Harry  reacted  instinctively:  As  Kreacher  lunged  for  the  poker standing in the grate, he launched himself upon the elf, flatten-ing  him.  Hermione’s  scream  mingled  with  Kreacher’s,  but  Harry bellowed louder than both of them: “Kreacher, I order you to stay still!” He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing from his sagging eyes. “Harry, let him up!” Hermione whispered. “So he can beat himself up with the poker?” snorted Harry, kneel-ing  beside  the  elf.  “I  don’t  think  so.  Right,  Kreacher,  I  want  the truth: How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?” “Kreacher saw him!” gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth. “Kreacher saw him com-ing  out  of  Kreacher’s  cupboard  with  his  hands  full  of  Kreacher’s treasures.  Kreacher  told  the  sneak  thief  to  stop,  but  Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r-ran. . . .” “You  called  the  locket  ‘Master  Regulus’s,’ ”  said  Harry.  “Why? Where  did  it  come  from?  What  did  Regulus  have  to  do  with  it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it!” The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his  knees,  and  began  to  rock  backward  and  forward.  When  he (cid:145) 192 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, echo-ing kitchen. “Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke my Mistress’s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regu-lus had proper pride; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns . . . and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve . . . “And one day, a year after he had joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said . . . he said . . . The old elf rocked faster than ever. “. . . he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.” “Voldemort needed an elf ?” Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did. “Oh  yes,”  moaned  Kreacher.  “And  Master  Regulus  had  volun-teered Kreacher. It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do . . . and then to c-come home.” Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs. “So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher  what  they  were  to  do,  but  took  Kreacher  with  him  to  a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake . . .” The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stood up. Kreacher’s croak-ing voice seemed to come to him from across that dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present. (cid:145) 193 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN “. . . There was a boat . . .” Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward  the  island  in  the  center.  This,  then,  was  how  Voldemort had  tested  the  defenses  surrounding  the  Horcrux:  by  borrowing  a disposable creature, a house-elf . . . “There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it. . . .” The elf quaked from head to foot. “Kreacher  drank,  and  as  he  drank,  he  saw  terrible  things.  .  .  . Kreacher’s insides burned. . . . Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed. . . . He made Kreacher drink all the potion. . . . He dropped a locket into the empty basin. . . . He filled it with more potion. “And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island. . . .” Harry  could  see  it  happening.  He  watched  Voldemort’s  white, snakelike  face  vanishing  into  darkness,  those  red  eyes  fixed  piti-lessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes, whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning po-tion caused its victim. . . . But here, Harry’s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how Kreacher had escaped. “Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island’s edge and he drank from the black lake . . . and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface. . . .” “How did you get away?” Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering. bloodshot eyes. Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked at Harry with his great, (cid:145) 194 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE “Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he said. “I know — but how did you escape the Inferi?” Kreacher did not seem to understand. “Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he repeated. “I know, but —” “Well,  it’s  obvious,  isn’t  it,  Harry?”  said  Ron.  “He  Disappa-rated!” “But  .  .  .  you  couldn’t  Apparate  in  and  out  of  that  cave,”  said Harry, “otherwise Dumbledore —” “Elf  magic  isn’t  like  wizard’s  magic,  is  it?”  said  Ron.  “I  mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can’t.” There was silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such a mistake? But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy. “Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves  far  beneath  his  notice,  just  like  all  the  purebloods  who  treat them  like  animals.  .  .  .  It  would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn’t.” “The  house-elf’s  highest  law  is  his  Master’s  bidding,”  intoned Kreacher.  “Kreacher  was  told  to  come  home,  so  Kreacher  came home. . . .” “Well, then, you did what you were told, didn’t you?” said Her-mione kindly. “You didn’t disobey orders at all!” Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever. “So  what  happened  when  you  got  back?”  Harry  asked.  “What did Regulus say when you told him what had happened?” “Master  Regulus  was  very  worried,  very  worried,”  croaked Kreacher. “Master Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to (cid:145) 195 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN leave the house.

Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Mas-ter Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell . . . and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord. . . .” And so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resem-bled Sirius. . . . Kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to  the  underground  cavern,  knew  how  to  raise  the  tiny  boat;  this time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison. . . . “And he made you drink the potion?” said Harry, disgusted. But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione’s hands leapt to her mouth: She seemed to have understood something. “M-Master  Regulus  took  from  his  pocket  a  locket  like  the  one the Dark Lord had,” said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. “And he told Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets. . . .” Kreacher’s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concen-trate hard to understand him. “And he ordered — Kreacher to leave — without him. And he told Kreacher — to go home — and never to tell my Mistress — what he had done — but to destroy — the first locket. And he drank  —  all  the  potion  —  and  Kreacher  swapped  the  lockets  — and watched . . . as Master Regulus . . . was dragged beneath the water . . . and . . .” “Oh, Kreacher!” wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, quite obviously repulsed.

The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glis-tening  around  his  snout,  a  bruise  already  blooming  on  his  pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and blood-shot  and  swimming  in  tears.  Harry  had  never  seen  anything  so pitiful. “So you brought the locket home,” he said relentlessly, for he was determined to know the full story. “And you tried to destroy it?” “Nothing  Kreacher  did  made  any  mark  upon  it,”  moaned  the elf.  “Kreacher  tried  everything,  everything  he  knew,  but  nothing, nothing would work. . . .

Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he punished  himself,  he  tried  again.  Kreacher  failed  to  obey  orders, Kreacher  could  not  destroy  the  locket!  And  his  Mistress  was  mad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared, and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave. . . .” Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coher-ent  words.  Tears  flowed  down  Hermione’s  cheeks  as  she  watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who was (cid:145) 197 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN no fan of Kreacher’s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head, trying to clear it. “I don’t understand you, Kreacher,” he said finally. “Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to go  to  Narcissa  and  Bellatrix,  and  pass  information  to  Voldemort through them. . . .” “Harry, Kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said Hermione, wip-ing her eyes on the back of her hand. “He’s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn’t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He’s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you’re going to say,” she went on as Harry began to protest, “that Regulus changed his mind . . . but he doesn’t seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus’s family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all.” “Sirius —” “Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it’s no good looking like that, you know it’s true. Kreacher had been alone for a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. I’m sure ‘Miss Cissy’ and ‘Miss Bella’ were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know. I’ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did . . . and so did Sirius.” Harry  had  no  retort.  As  he  watched  Kreacher  sobbing  on  the (cid:145) 198 (cid:145) \\x0cKREACHER’S  TALE floor, he remembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius’s death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human’s. . . . “Kreacher,” said Harry after a while, “when you feel up to it, er . . . please sit up.” It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into si-lence. Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child. “Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,” said Harry. He glanced at Hermione for assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend that it was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval: She smiled encouragingly. “Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need to find out where the locket — where Master Regulus’s locket is. It’s really important. We want to finish the work Master Regulus started, we want to — er — ensure that he didn’t die in vain.” Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry. “Find Mundungus Fletcher?” he croaked. “And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. “Do you think you could do that for us?” As  Kreacher  nodded  and  got  to  his  feet,  Harry  had  a  sudden inspiration.  He  pulled  out  Hagrid’s  purse  and  took  out  the  fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to Voldemort. “Kreacher,  I’d,  er,  like  you  to  have  this,”  he  said,  pressing  the locket into the elf’s hand. “This belonged to Regulus and I’m sure he’d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you —” (cid:145) 199 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TEN “Overkill, mate,” said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and misery, and threw himself back onto the ground. It  took  them  nearly  half  an  hour  to  calm  down  Kreacher,  who was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its protec-tion their first priority while he was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in Her-mione’s direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack. (cid:145) 200 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  E L E V E N THE BRIBE     I f Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that after-noon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help. Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside num-ber  twelve,  and  they  remained  there  into  the  night,  gazing  in  the direction of the house that they could not see. “Death Eaters, for sure,” said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched  from  the  drawing  room  windows.  “Reckon  they  know we’re in here?” “I don’t think so,” said Hermione, though she looked frightened, “or they’d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn’t they?” (cid:145) 201 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN “D’you  reckon  he’s  been  in  here  and  had  his  tongue  tied  by Moody’s curse?” asked Ron. “Yes,” said Hermione, “otherwise he’d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn’t he? But they’re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, after all.” “How do they — ?” began Harry. “Wizarding  wills  are  examined  by  the  Ministry,  remember? They’ll know Sirius left you the place.” The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. They had not heard a word from any-one beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley’s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket: This  particularly  infuriated  Hermione,  who  was  whiling  away  the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off. “Will you stop it!” she cried on the third evening of Kreacher’s absence, as all light was sucked from the drawing room yet again. “Sorry, sorry!” said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. “I don’t know I’m doing it!” “Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?” “What, like reading kids’ stories?” “Dumbledore left me this book, Ron —” “—  and  he  left  me  the  Deluminator,  maybe  I’m  supposed  to use it!” Unable  to  stand  the  bickering,  Harry  slipped  out  of  the  room unnoticed  by  either  of  them.  He  headed  downstairs  toward  the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where (cid:145) 202 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BRIBE Kreacher  was  most  likely  to  reappear.  Halfway  down  the  flight  of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain. Every  nerve  in  his  body  seemed  to  tauten:  He  pulled  out  his wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside,  and  a  cloaked  figure  edged  into  the  hall  and  closed  the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody’s voice asked, “Severus Snape?” Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand. “It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice. The jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was im-possible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind. Harry pointed his wand into the middle of it. “Don’t move!” He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell,  the  curtains  hiding  her  flew  open  and  she  began  to  scream, “Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house —” Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below. “Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!” “Oh, thank goodness,” said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did not. “Show yourself!” he called back. Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender. (cid:145) 203 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN “I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nympha-dora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.” “Oh,  all  right,”  said  Harry,  lowering  his  wand,  “but  I  had  to check, didn’t I?” “Speaking  as  your  ex-Defense  Against  the  Dark  Arts  teacher,  I quite agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be quite so quick to lower your defenses.” They ran down the stairs toward him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them. “No sign of Severus, then?” he asked. “No,” said Harry. “What’s going on? Is everyone okay?” “Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside —” “We know —” “I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry. Let’s  go  downstairs,  there’s  a  lot  to  tell  you,  and  I  want  to  know what happened after you left the Burrow.” They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate. A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table.  Lupin  pulled  a  few  butterbeers  from  beneath  his  traveling cloak and they sat down. “I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the   (cid:145) 204 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BRIBE Death  Eater  tailing  me,”  said  Lupin.  “So,  you  came  straight  here after the wedding?” “No,” said Harry, “only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a café on Tottenham Court Road.” Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. “What?” They  explained  what  had  happened;  when  they  had  finished, Lupin looked aghast. “But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track anyone  who  Apparates,  unless  you  grab  hold  of  them  as  they disappear!” “And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Totten-ham Court Road at the time, does it?” said Harry. “We wondered,” said Hermione tentatively, “whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?” “Impossible,” said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. “Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that’s worrying, really worrying.” He  looked  disturbed,  but  as  far  as  Harry  was  concerned,  that question could wait. “Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing since Ron’s dad told us the family were safe.” “Well, Kingsley saved us,” said Lupin. “Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.” “Were  they  Death  Eaters  or  Ministry  people?”  interjected Hermione.  (cid:145) 205 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN “A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now,” said Lupin. “There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to  torture  your  whereabouts  out  of  Scrimgeour  before  they  killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.” Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrim-geour  much,  but  if  what  Lupin  said  was  true,  the  man’s  final  act had been to try to protect Harry. “The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,” Lu-pin went on. “They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get too close — and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there. “At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death  Eaters  were  forcing  their  way  into  every  Order-connected house  in  the  country.  No  deaths,”  he  added  quickly,  forestalling the  question,  “but  they  were  rough.  They  burned  down  Dedalus Diggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there, and they used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks’s family. Again, trying to find out where you went after you visited them. They’re all right — shaken, obvi-ously, but otherwise okay.” “The  Death  Eaters  got  through  all  those  protective  charms?” Harry  asked,  remembering  how  effective  these  had  been  on  the night he had crashed in Tonks’s parents’ garden. “What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,” said Lupin. “They’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of   (cid:145) 206 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BRIBE identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they’d come.” “And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry’s whereabouts out of people?” asked Hermione, an edge to her voice. “Well,” said Lupin. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet. “Here,” he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, “you’ll know sooner or later anyway. That’s their pretext for going after you.” Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. He read the headline over it: WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said noth-ing. He pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read any more: He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed  him  and,  as  Rita  Skeeter  had  already  told  the  Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen. “I’m sorry, Harry,” Lupin said. “So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?” asked Hermione furiously. Lupin nodded. “But surely people realize what’s going on?” “The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,” said Lupin.   (cid:145) 207 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN “The official version of Scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned; he has  been  replaced  by  Pius  Thicknesse,  who  is  under  the  Imperius Curse.” “Why  didn’t  Voldemort  declare  himself  Minister  of  Magic?” asked Ron. Lupin laughed. “He doesn’t need to, Ron. Effectively he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry. “Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren’t confide in each  other,  not  knowing  whom  to  trust;  they  are  scared  to  speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes,  Voldemort  is  playing  a  very  clever  game.  Declaring  himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has cre-ated confusion, uncertainty, and fear.” “And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,” said Harry, “involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?” “That’s certainly part of it,” said Lupin, “and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you — the Boy Who Lived — were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Volde-mort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero’s death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you. “Meanwhile,  the  Ministry  has  started  moving  against  Muggle-borns.” (cid:145) 208 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BRIBE Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet. “Look at page two.” Hermione  turned  the  pages  with  much  the  same  expression  of distaste she had worn when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art. “ ‘Muggle-born Register,’ ” she read aloud. “ ‘The Ministry of Magic is  undertaking  a  survey  of  so-called  “Muggle-borns,”  the  better  to  un-derstand how they came to possess magical secrets. “ ‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that  magic  can  only  be  passed  from  person  to  person  when  Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force. “ ‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magi-cal  power,  and  to  this  end  has  issued  an  invitation  to  every  so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.’ ” “People won’t let this happen,” said Ron. “It  is  happening,  Ron,”  said  Lupin.  “Muggle-borns  are  being rounded up as we speak.” “But how are they supposed to have ‘stolen’ magic?” said Ron. “It’s mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn’t be any Squibs, would there?” “I know,” said Lupin. “Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.” Ron  glanced  at  Hermione,  then  said,  “What  if  purebloods  and half-bloods swear a Muggle-born’s part of their family? I’ll tell ev-eryone Hermione’s my cousin —” (cid:145) 209 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN Hermione covered Ron’s hand with hers and squeezed it. “Thank you, Ron, but I couldn’t let you —” “You won’t have a choice,” said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. “I’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it. Hermione gave a shaky laugh. “Ron, as we’re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don’t think it matters. If I was going back to  school  it  would  be  different.  What’s  Voldemort  planning  for Hogwarts?” she asked Lupin. “Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wiz-ard,” he replied. “That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, be-cause it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and  wizard  in  Britain  has  been  educated  at  Hogwarts,  but  their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it’s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status — meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent — before they are allowed to attend.” Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds  would  be  poring  over  stacks  of  newly  purchased  spell-books, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again either. “It’s . . . it’s . . .” he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly, “I know.” Lupin hesitated.  (cid:145) 210 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BRIBE “I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.” “He did,” Harry replied, “and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they’re coming with me.” “Can you confide in me what the mission is?” Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer. “I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell you I don’t think I can.” “I thought you’d say that,” said Lupin, looking disappointed. “But I might still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.” Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission  secret  from  Lupin  if  he  were with them all the time he could not imagine. Hermione, however, looked puzzled. “But what about Tonks?” she asked. “What about her?” said Lupin. “Well,” said Hermione, frowning, “you’re married! How does she feel about you going away with us?” “Tonks will be perfectly safe,” said Lupin. “She’ll be at her par-ents’ house.” There was something strange in Lupin’s tone; it was almost cold. There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hid-den at her parents’ house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action.  (cid:145) 211 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN “Remus,” said Hermione tentatively, “is everything all right . . . you know . . . between you and —” “Everything is fine, thank you,” said Lupin pointedly. Hermione  turned  pink.  There  was  another  pause,  an  awkward and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, “Tonks is going to have a baby.” “Oh, how wonderful!” squealed Hermione. “Excellent!” said Ron enthusiastically. “Congratulations,” said Harry. Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said,  “So  .  .  .  do  you  accept  my  offer?  Will  three  become  four?  I cannot  believe  that  Dumbledore  would  have  disapproved,  he  ap-pointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I believe that we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.” Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry. “Just — just to be clear,” he said. “You want to leave Tonks at her parents’ house and come away with us?” “She’ll be perfectly safe there, they’ll look after her,” said Lupin. He spoke with a finality bordering on indifference. “Harry, I’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.” “Well,”  said  Harry  slowly,  “I’m  not.  I’m  pretty  sure  my  father would have wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own kid, actually.” Lupin’s  face  drained  of  color.  The  temperature  in  the  kitchen might  have  dropped  ten  degrees.  Ron  stared  around  the  room  as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione’s eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin. (cid:145) 212 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BRIBE “You don’t understand,” said Lupin at last. “Explain, then,” said Harry. Lupin swallowed. “I — I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and I have regretted it very much ever since.” “I see,” said Harry, “so you’re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?” Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever, the shadow of the wolf upon his human face. “Don’t you understand what I’ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I’ve made her an outcast!” Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. “You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dum-bledore’s protection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of the Wizarding  world  sees  creatures  like  me!  When  they  know  of  my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don’t you see what I’ve done? Even  her  own  family  is  disgusted  by  our  marriage,  what  parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the child — the child —” Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged. “My kind don’t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it — how can I forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, with-out a father of whom it must always be ashamed!” “Remus!”  whispered  Hermione,  tears  in  her  eyes.  “Don’t  say that — how could any child be ashamed of you?” (cid:145) 213 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN “Oh, I don’t know, Hermione,” said Harry. “I’d be pretty ashamed of him.” Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him. “If  the  new  regime  thinks  Muggle-borns  are  bad,”  Harry  said, “what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father’s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he’d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?” “How — how dare you?” said Lupin. “This is not about a desire for — for danger or personal glory — how dare you suggest such a —” “I think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil,” Harry said. “You fancy stepping into Sirius’s shoes —” “Harry,  no!”  Hermione  begged  him,  but  he  continued  to  glare into Lupin’s livid face. “I’d never have believed this,” Harry said. “The man who taught me to fight dementors — a coward.” Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor,  he  glimpsed  the  tail  of  Lupin’s  cloak  disappearing  around the door. “Remus, Remus, come back!” Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam. “Harry!” wailed Hermione. “How could you?” “It was easy,” said Harry. He stood up; he could feel a lump swell-ing where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking. (cid:145) 214 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BRIBE “Don’t look at me like that!” he snapped at Hermione. “Don’t you start on her!” snarled Ron. “No — no — we mustn’t fight!” said Hermione, launching her-self between them. “You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,” Ron told Harry. “He had it coming to him,” said Harry. Broken images were rac-ing  each  other  through  his  mind:  Sirius  falling  through  the  veil; Dumbledore  suspended,  broken,  in  midair;  a  flash  of  green  light and his mother’s voice, begging for mercy . . . “Parents,” said Harry, “shouldn’t leave their kids unless — unless they’ve got to.” “Harry —” said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking  reassurance  about  James,  and  Lupin  had  consoled  him. Now Lupin’s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermi-one spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently. He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away from each other. “I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward.” “No, you shouldn’t,” said Ron at once. “But he’s acting like one.” “All the same . . .” said Hermione. “I know,” said Harry. “But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it’ll be worth it, won’t it?” He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking (cid:145) 215 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend? The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione’s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table, Harry’s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth. His  attention  caught,  Harry  examined  the  picture  more  care-fully. Dumbledore’s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby,  Ariana,  was  little  longer  than  a  loaf  of  bread  and  no  more distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet-black hair pulled into  a  high  bun.  Her  face  had  a  carved  quality  about  it.  Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he’d seen as he studied her dark  eyes,  high  cheekbones,  and  straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy  collared  jackets  and  had  identical,  shoulder-length  hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very  alike,  for  this  was  before  Albus’s  nose  had  been  broken  and before he started wearing glasses. (cid:145) 216 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BRIBE The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the newspaper. Baby Ariana’s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the picture and saw the headline:  EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM THE UPCOMING BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE  Thinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse than he by Rita Skeeter already did, Harry began to read:  Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her hus-band Percival’s well-publicized arrest and imprison-ment  in  Azkaban.  She  therefore  decided  to  uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the vil-lage that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter’s strange escape from You-Know-Who. Like  Mould-on-the-Wold,  Godric’s  Hollow  was home  to  a  number  of  Wizarding  families,  but  as Kendra  knew  none  of  them,  she  would  be  spared the  curiosity  about  her  husband’s  crime  she  had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new Wizarding neigh-bors, she soon ensured that her family was left well alone. “Slammed  the  door  in  my  face  when  I  went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,” says Bathilda Bagshot. “The first (cid:145) 217 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN year they were there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn’t  have  known  there  was  a  daughter  if  I hadn’t been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn’t know what to make of it.” It seems that Kendra thought the move to God-ric’s  Hollow  was  the  perfect  opportunity  to  hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most ex-perts  agree  that  magic  will  have  revealed  itself,  if present.  Nobody  now  alive  remembers  Ariana  ever demonstrating  even  the  slightest  sign  of  magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a  decision  to  hide  her  daughter’s  existence  rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had pro-duced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The tiny number of people  who  henceforth  knew  of  Ariana’s  existence could be counted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them: “My sister is too frail for school.” Next week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts — the Prizes and the Pretense. (cid:145) 218 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BRIBE Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him feel  worse.  He  looked  back  at  the  photograph  of  the  apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him; he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the newspa-per, to ask Ron’s and Hermione’s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen. For  the  first  time  in  three  days  Harry  had  forgotten  all  about Kreacher.  His  immediate  thought  was  that  Lupin  had  burst  back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his  chair.  He  hurried  to  his  feet  as  Kreacher  disentangled  himself and,  bowing  low  to  Harry,  croaked,  “Kreacher  has  returned  with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.” Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him. “Expelliarmus!” Mundungus’s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch. “What?”  he  bellowed,  writhing  in  his  attempts  to  free  himself from  Ron’s  grip.  “Wha’ve  I  done?  Setting  a  bleedin’  ’ouse-elf  on me, what are you playing at, wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, or —” “You’re not in much of a position to make threats,” said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped  to  his  knees  beside  Mundungus,  who  stopped  struggling and  looked  terrified.  Ron  got  up,  panting,  and  watched  as  Harry (cid:145) 219 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN pointed  his  wand  deliberately  at  Mundungus’s  nose.  Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke: His hair was matted and his robes stained. “Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,” croaked  the  elf.  “Fletcher  knows  how  to  avoid  capture,  has  many hidey-holes  and  accomplices.  Nevertheless,  Kreacher  cornered  the thief in the end.” “You’ve done really well, Kreacher,” said Harry, and the elf bowed low. “Right, we’ve got a few questions for you,” Harry told Mundun-gus, who shouted at once, “I  panicked,  okay?  I  never  wanted  to  come  along,  no  offense, mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, an’ that was bleedin’ You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta there, I said all along I didn’t wanna do it —” “For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,” said Hermione. “Well, you’re a bunch of bleedin’ ’eroes then, aren’t you, but I never pretended I was up for killing meself —” “We’re  not  interested  in  why  you  ran  out  on  Mad-Eye,”  said Harry,  moving  his  wand  a  little  closer  to  Mundungus’s  baggy, bloodshot  eyes.  “We  already  knew  you  were  an  unreliable  bit  of scum.” “Well then, why the ’ell am I being ’unted down by ’ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblets again? I ain’t got none of ’em left, or you could ’ave ’em —” “It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re getting warmer,” said Harry. “Shut up and listen.” It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he (cid:145) 220 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BRIBE could demand some small portion of truth. Harry’s wand was now so close to the bridge of Mundungus’s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. “When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,” Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted him again. “Sirius never cared about any of the junk —” There was the sound of pattering feet, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, and a shriek of agony: Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan. “Call  ’im  off,  call  ’im  off,  ’e  should  be  locked  up!”  screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again. “Kreacher, no!” shouted Harry. Kreacher’s thin arms trembled with  the  weight  of  the  pan,  still held aloft. “Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?” Ron laughed. “We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading you can do the honors,” said Harry. “Thank you very much, Master,” said Kreacher with a bow, and he  retreated  a  short  distance,  his  great  pale  eyes  still  fixed  upon Mundungus with loathing. “When  you  stripped  this  house  of  all  the  valuables  you  could find,”  Harry  began  again,  “you  took  a  bunch  of  stuff  from  the kitchen  cupboard.  There  was  a  locket  there.”  Harry’s  mouth  was suddenly dry: He could sense Ron and Hermione’s tension and ex-citement too. “What did you do with it?” “Why?” asked Mundungus. “Is it valuable?” “You’ve still got it!” cried Hermione. (cid:145) 221 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  ELEVEN “No, he hasn’t,” said Ron shrewdly. “He’s wondering whether he should have asked more money for it.” “More?” said Mundungus. “That wouldn’t have been effing dif-ficult . . . bleedin’ gave it away, di’n’ I? No choice.” “What do you mean?” “I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I’ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin’ snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an’ told me she’d take it and let me off that time, and to fink meself lucky.” “Who was this woman?” asked Harry. “I dunno, some Ministry hag.” Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. “Little woman. Bow on top of ’er head.” He frowned and then added, “Looked like a toad.” Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, which ignited. “Aguamenti!”  screamed  Hermione,  and  a  jet  of  water  streamed from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus. Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron’s and Hermione’s faces. The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again. (cid:145) 222 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E L V E MAGIC IS MIGHT     A s  August  wore  on,  the  square  of  unkempt  grass  in  the middle  of  Grimmauld  Place  shriveled  in  the  sun  until  it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anybody in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve itself. The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since  accepted  the  amusing  mistake  in  the  numbering  that  had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen. And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed  to  find  the  anomaly  most  intriguing.  Barely  a  day  passed without  one  or  two  people  arriving  in  Grimmauld  Place  with  no other  purpose,  or  so  it  seemed,  than  to  lean  against  the  railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two  houses.  The  lurkers  were  never  the  same  two  days  running, although  they  all  seemed  to  share  a  dislike  for  normal  clothing. Most  of  the  Londoners  who  passed  them  were  used  to  eccentric dressers  and  took  little  notice,  though  occasionally  one  of  them (cid:145) 223 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE might  glance  back,  wondering  why  anyone  would  wear  such  long cloaks in this heat. The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had  seen  something  interesting  at  last,  only  to  fall  back  looking disappointed. On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed. Meanwhile,  inside  number  twelve,  Harry  had  just  entered  the hall. He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might  have  caught  a  glimpse  of  his  momentarily  exposed  elbow. Shutting  the  front  door  carefully  behind  him,  he  pulled  off  the Invisibility  Cloak,  draped  it  over  his  arm,  and  hurried  along  the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand. The usual low whisper of “Severus Snape?” greeted him, the chill wind swept him, and his tongue rolled up for a moment. “I didn’t kill you,” he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath  as  the  dusty  jinx-figure  exploded.  He  waited  until  he  was (cid:145) 224 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, “I’ve got news, and you won’t like it.” The  kitchen  was  almost  unrecognizable.  Every  surface  now shone:  Copper  pots  and  pans  had  been  burnished  to  a  rosy  glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically  different  than  the  house-elf  who  now  came  hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean and  fluffy  as  cotton  wool,  Regulus’s  locket  bouncing  on  his  thin chest. “Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed be-fore  dinner,”  croaked  Kreacher,  seizing  the  Invisibility  Cloak  and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered. “What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermi-one had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the news-paper on top of their scattered parchment. A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read: SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER “No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly. Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and be-gan to read the accompanying story out loud. (cid:145) 225 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE “ ‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of  Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of  Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. “ ‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding tradi-tions and values —’ Like committing murder and cutting off peo-ple’s  ears,  I  suppose!  Snape,  headmaster!  Snape  in  Dumbledore’s study  —  Merlin’s  pants!”  she  shrieked,  making  both  Harry  and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a minute!” “ ‘Merlin’s  pants’?”  repeated  Ron,  looking  amused.  “She  must be  upset.”  He  pulled  the  newspaper  toward  him  and  perused  the article about Snape. “The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flit-wick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won’t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?” “Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it’s all friends together. And,” Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, “I can’t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it’ll be a  choice  between  staying  and  teaching,  or  a  nice  few  years  in  Az-kaban — and that’s if they’re lucky. I reckon they’ll stay to try and protect the students.” Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his   (cid:145) 226 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so. “Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape’s face. “Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.” He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher’s cooking  had  improved  dramatically  ever  since  he  had  been  given Regulus’s locket: Today’s French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted. “There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house,” he told Ron as he ate, “more than usual. It’s like they’re hoping we’ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hog-warts Express.” Ron glanced at his watch. “I’ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn’t it?” In his mind’s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wonder-ing  where  he,  Ron,  and  Hermione  were,  or  debating  how  best  to undermine Snape’s new regime. “They nearly saw me coming back in just now,” Harry said. “I landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.” “I do that every time. Oh, here she is,” Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen. “And what in the name of Merlin’s most baggy Y Fronts was that about?” “I remembered this,” Hermione panted.  (cid:145) 227 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting inside, and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much else, into the bag’s capacious depths. “Phineas  Nigellus,”  Hermione  explained  as  she  threw  the  bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash. “Sorry?” said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of  Phineas  Nigellus  Black  was  able  to  flit  between  his  portrait  in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s office at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore’s collec-tion of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor. “Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,” Hermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat. “But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.” “Good thinking!” said Ron, looking impressed. “Thank  you,”  smiled  Hermione,  pulling  her  soup  toward  her. “So, Harry, what else happened today?” “Nothing,” said Harry. “Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw your dad, though, Ron. He looks fine.” Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring (cid:145) 228 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious. “Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,” Ron said. “That’s why we haven’t seen Umbridge, she’d never walk, she’d think she’s too important.” “And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?” Hermione asked. “Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,” said Ron. “How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?” Hermi-one asked, her soupspoon suspended in midair. “Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.” “But you never told us that!” Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen. “There’s  nothing  in  here  about  navy  blue  robes,  nothing!”  she said, flipping feverishly through the pages. “Well, does it really matter?” “Ron, it all matters! If we’re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when they’re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We’ve been over and over this, I mean, what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren’t even bothering to tell us —” “Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing —” “You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no more dan-gerous  place  in  the  whole  world  for  us  to  be  right  now  than  the Ministry of —” “I think we should do it tomorrow,” said Harry. (cid:145) 229 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE Hermione  stopped  dead,  her  jaw  hanging;  Ron  choked  a  little over his soup. “Tomorrow?” repeated Hermione. “You aren’t serious, Harry?” “I am,” said Harry. “I don’t think we’re going to be much better prepared  than  we  are  now  even  if  we  skulk  around  the  Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be. There’s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn’t open.” “Unless,”  said  Ron,  “she’s  found  a  way  of  opening  it  and  she’s now possessed.” “Wouldn’t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,” Harry shrugged. Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought. “We  know  everything  important,”  Harry  went  on,  addressing Hermione. “We know they’ve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members are al-lowed  to  connect  their  homes  to  the  Floo  Network  now,  because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge’s office is, because of what you heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate —” “ ‘I’ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,’ ” Hermione re-cited immediately. “Exactly,” said Harry. “And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch bor-rowing one from her friend —” “But we haven’t got any!” “If the plan works, we will have,” Harry continued calmly. “I don’t know, Harry, I don’t know. . . . There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance. . . .” (cid:145) 230 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT “That’ll be true even if we spend another three months prepar-ing,” said Harry. “It’s time to act.” He  could  tell  from  Ron’s  and  Hermione’s  faces  that  they  were scared;  he  was  not  particularly  confident  himself,  and  yet  he  was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation. They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the Minis-try, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their  conversations,  and  learned  by  careful  observation  which  of them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the same time every day. Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebody’s briefcase. Slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione. “All right,” said Ron slowly, “let’s say we go for it tomorrow. . . . I think it should just be me and Harry.” “Oh, don’t start that again!” sighed Hermione. “I thought we’d settled this.” “It’s  one  thing  hanging  around  the  entrances  under  the  Cloak, but this is different, Hermione.” Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously. “You’re on the list of Muggle-borns who didn’t present themselves for interrogation!” “And you’re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If anyone shouldn’t go, it’s Harry, he’s got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head —” “Fine, I’ll stay here,” said Harry. “Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won’t you?” As  Ron  and  Hermione  laughed,  pain  shot  through  the  scar  on Harry’s forehead. His hand jumped to it: He saw Hermione’s eyes (cid:145) 231 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE narrow, and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes. “Well, if all three of us go we’ll have to Disapparate separately,” Ron was saying. “We can’t all fit under the Cloak anymore.” Harry’s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried forward. “Master has not finished his soup, would Master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?” “Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute — er — bath-room.” Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hur-ried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes. . . . He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of  him  had  high,  timbered  gables;  they  looked  like  gingerbread houses. He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a mount-ing excitement. . . . The door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into Harry’s face: humor gone, terror replacing it. . . . “Gregorovitch?” said a high, cold voice. She shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, prevented her shutting him out. . . . “I want Gregorovitch.” “Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!” she cried, shaking her head. “He no live here! He no live here! I know him not!” (cid:145) 232 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT Abandoning  the  attempt  to  close  the  door,  she  began  to  back away down the dark hall, and Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand. “Where is he?” “Das weiß ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!” He  raised  the  wand.  She  screamed.  Two  young  children  came running into the hall. She tried to shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light — “Harry! HARRY!” He  opened  his  eyes;  he  had  sunk  to  the  floor.  Hermione  was pounding on the door again. “Harry, open up!” He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom. “What were you doing?” asked Hermione sternly. “What  d’you  think  I  was  doing?”  asked  Harry  with  feeble bravado. “You were yelling your head off!” said Ron. “Oh yeah . . . I must’ve dozed off or —” “Harry, please don’t insult our intelligence,” said Hermione, tak-ing deep breaths. “We know your scar hurt downstairs, and you’re white as a sheet.” Harry sat down on the edge of the bath. “Fine.  I’ve  just  seen  Voldemort  murdering  a  woman.  By  now he’s probably killed her whole family. And he didn’t need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there. . . .” “Harry,  you  aren’t  supposed  to  let  this  happen  anymore!” (cid:145) 233 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom. “Dum-bledore wanted you to use Occlumency! He thought the connection was dangerous — Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it help?” “Because it means I know what he’s doing,” said Harry. “So you’re not even going to try to shut him out?” “Hermione, I can’t. You know I’m lousy at Occlumency, I never got the hang of it.” “You never really tried!” she said hotly. “I don’t get it, Harry — do  you  like  having  this  special  connection  or  relationship  or what — whatever —” She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up. “Like it?” he said quietly. “Would you like it?” “I — no — I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean —” “I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he’s most dangerous. But I’m going to use it.” “Dumbledore —” “Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else’s. I want to know why he’s after Gregorovitch.” “Who?” “He’s a foreign wandmaker,” said Harry. “He made Krum’s wand and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.” “But according to you,” said Ron, “Voldemort’s got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he’s already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?” “Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better . . . or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what  my  wand  did  when  he  was  chasing  me,  because  Ollivander didn’t know.” (cid:145) 234 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back. “Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,” said Her-mione, “but you made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?” “Because I know it wasn’t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!” They  glared  at  each  other:  Harry  knew  that  he  had  not  con-vinced  Hermione  and  that  she  was  marshaling  counterarguments, against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was per-mitting  himself  to  see  into  Voldemort’s  mind.  To  his  relief,  Ron intervened. “Drop it,” he advised her. “It’s up to him. And if we’re going to the  Ministry  tomorrow,  don’t  you  reckon  we  should  go  over  the plan?” Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the mat-ter rest, though Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart. They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it, word per-fect, to each other. Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius’s room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his fa-ther, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort sought him so determinedly. (cid:145) 235 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste. “You look terrible,” was Ron’s greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry. “Not for long,” said Harry, yawning. They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served  coffee  and  hot  rolls  by  Kreacher  and  wearing  the  slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review. “Robes,” she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, “Polyjuice Potion . . . Invisibility Cloak . . . Decoy Detonators . . . You should each take a couple just in case. . . . Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Nougat, Extendable Ears . . .” They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing  them  out  and  promising  to  have  a  steak-and-kidney  pie ready for them when they returned. “Bless him,” said Ron fondly, “and when you think I used to fan-tasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.” They made their way onto the front step with immense caution: They  could  see  a  couple  of  puffy-eyed  Death  Eaters  watching  the house from across the misty square. Hermione  Disapparated  with  Ron  first,  then  came  back  for Harry. After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found  himself  in  the  tiny  alleyway  where  the  first  phase  of  their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, except for a  couple  of  large  bins;  the  first  Ministry  workers  did  not  usually appear here until at least eight o’clock. “Right then,” said Hermione, checking her watch. “She ought to be here in about five minutes. When I’ve Stunned her —” (cid:145) 236 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT “Hermione, we know,” said Ron sternly. “And I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here?” Hermione squealed. “I nearly forgot! Stand back —” She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make it look as though it was still closed. “And now,” she said, turning back to face the other two in the alleyway, “we put on the Cloak again —” “— and we wait,” Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione’s head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry. Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry  witch  with  flyaway  gray  hair  Apparated  feet  from  them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness; the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione’s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over. “Nicely  done,  Hermione,”  said  Ron,  emerging  from  behind  a bin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch’s head and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch’s handbag. “She’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small card that iden-tified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Of-fice. “You’d better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens.” (cid:145) 237 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., which he had taken from the witch’s purse. Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch. “We’re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.” They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione re-mained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, and a small, ferrety-looking wizard appeared before them. “Oh, hello, Mafalda.” “Hello!”  said  Hermione  in  a  quavery  voice.  “How  are  you today?” “Not  so  good,  actually,”  replied  the  little  wizard,  who  looked thoroughly downcast. As  Hermione  and  the  wizard  headed  for  the  main  road,  Harry and Ron crept along behind them. “I’m  sorry  to  hear  you’re  under  the  weather,”  said  Hermione, talking firmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the street. “Here, have a sweet.” “Eh? Oh, no thanks —” “I insist!” said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one. The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did   (cid:145) 238 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head. “Oh dear!” she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. “Perhaps you’d better take the day off!” “No — no!” He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight. “I must — today — must go —” “But that’s just silly!” said Hermione, alarmed. “You can’t go to work in this state — I think you ought to go to St. Mungo’s and get them to sort you out!” The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the main street. “You simply can’t go to work like this!” cried Hermione. At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a re-pulsed Hermione to claw his way back into a standing position, he turned  on  the  spot  and  vanished,  leaving  nothing  behind  but  the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit. “Urgh,” said Hermione, holding up the skirts of her robe to avoid the puddles of sick. “It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.” “Yeah,”  said  Ron,  emerging  from  under  the  cloak  holding  the wizard’s bag, “but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on  his  job, though, isn’t he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.” Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag.  (cid:145) 239 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE “Weird he wasn’t wearing them today, wasn’t it, seeing how much he  wanted  to  go?  Anyway,  I’m  Reg  Cattermole,  according  to  the label in the back.” “Now wait here,” Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, “and we’ll be back with some hairs for you.” He  had  to  wait  ten  minutes,  but  it  seemed  much  longer  to Harry,  skulking  alone  in  the  sick-splattered  alleyway  beside  the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared. “We don’t know who he is,” Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black hairs, “but he’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he’s pretty tall, you’ll need bigger robes. . . .” She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change. Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two. “Blimey, that’s scary,” said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him. “Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” Hermione told Harry, “and let’s go, it’s nearly nine.” They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded  pavement  there  were  spiked  black  railings  flanking  two flights of steps, one labeled gentlemen, the other ladies. “See you in a moment, then,” said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to ladies. Harry and Ron joined a num-ber of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an or-dinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white. (cid:145) 240 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT “Morning, Reg!” called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. “Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?” The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. “Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?” And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. To Harry’s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him. “We have to flush ourselves in?” he whispered. “Looks like it,” Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly. They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clam-bered into the toilet. He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he ap-peared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment had zoomed  down  a  short  chute,  emerging  out  of  a  fireplace  into  the Ministry of Magic. He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was  accustomed  to.  The  great  Atrium  seemed  darker  than  Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and (cid:145) 241 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE a  wizard  sitting  on  ornately  carved  thrones,  looking  down  at  the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words magic is might. Harry  received  a  heavy  blow  on  the  back  of  the  legs:  Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him. “Out of the way, can’t y — oh, sorry, Runcorn!” Clearly  frightened,  the  balding  wizard  hurried  away.  Appar-ently  the  man  whom  Harry  was  impersonating,  Runcorn,  was intimidating. “Psst!”  said  a  voice,  and  he  looked  around  to  see  a  wispy  little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join them. “You got in all right, then?” Hermione whispered to Harry. “No, he’s still stuck in the bog,” said Ron. “Oh, very funny . . . It’s horrible, isn’t it?” she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue. “Have you seen  what they’re sitting on? Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were  decoratively  carved  thrones  were  actually  mounds  of  carved humans:  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  naked  bodies,  men,  women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards. “Muggles,” whispered Hermione. “In their rightful place. Come on, let’s get going.” They  joined  the  stream  of  witches  and  wizards  moving  toward the golden gates at the end of the hall, looking around as surrepti-tiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller (cid:145) 242 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT hall,  where  queues  were  forming  in  front  of  twenty  golden  grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, “Cattermole!” They looked around: Harry’s stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore’s death was striding toward  them.  The  Ministry  workers  beside  them  fell  silent,  their eyes  downcast;  Harry  could  feel  fear  rippling  through  them.  The man’s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent,  sweeping  robes,  which  were  embroidered  with  much gold thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophan-tically, “Morning, Yaxley!” Yaxley ignored them. “I  requested  somebody  from  Magical  Maintenance  to  sort  out my office, Cattermole. It’s still raining in there.” Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would in-tervene, but nobody spoke. “Raining . . . in your office? That’s — that’s not good, is it?” Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley’s eyes widened. “You think it’s funny, Cattermole, do you?” A  pair  of  witches  broke  away  from  the  queue  for  the  lift  and bustled off. “No,” said Ron, “no, of course —” “You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I’m quite surprised you’re not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.” Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She coughed feebly and turned away. “I — I —” stammered Ron. (cid:145) 243 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWELVE “But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley, “— not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth — and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforce-ment needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?” “Yes,” whispered Ron. “Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an hour, your wife’s Blood Status will be in even graver doubt than it is now.” The  golden  grille  before  them  clattered  open.  With  a  nod  and unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreci-ate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward. “What am I going to do?” Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. “If I don’t turn up, my wife — I mean, Cattermole’s wife —” “We’ll  come  with  you,  we  should  stick  together  —”  began Harry, but Ron shook his head feverishly. “That’s mental, we haven’t got much time. You two find Um-bridge, I’ll go and sort out Yaxley’s office — but how do I stop it raining?” “Try Finite Incantatem,” said Hermione at once, “that should stop the rain if it’s a hex or curse; if it doesn’t, something’s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings —” “Say  it  again,  slowly  —”  said  Ron,  searching  his  pockets  des-perately for a quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. (cid:145) 244 (cid:145) \\x0cMAGIC  IS  MIGHT A disembodied female voice said, “Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advi-sory Bureau,” and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift. “Morning,  Albert,”  said  a  bushily  whiskered  man,  smiling  at Harry.  He  glanced  over  at  Ron  and  Hermione  as  the  lift  creaked upward once more; Hermione was now whispering frantic instruc-tions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and mut-tered, “Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I’m pretty confident I’ll get his job now!” He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; the grilles opened once more. “Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, includ-ing  the  Improper  Use  of  Magic  Office,  Auror  Headquarters,  and Wizengamot Administration Services,” said the disembodied witch’s voice. Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed by the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione said, very fast, “Actually, Harry, I think I’d better go after him, I don’t think he knows what he’s doing and if he gets caught the whole thing —” “Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.” The  golden  grilles  slid  apart  again  and  Hermione  gasped.  Four people stood before them, two of them deep in conversation: a long-haired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and a squat,  toadlike  witch  wearing  a  velvet  bow  in  her  short  hair  and clutching a clipboard to her chest. (cid:145) 245 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T H I R T E E N  THE MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION  A h, Mafalda!” said Umbridge, looking at Hermione. “Trav-ers sent you, did he?” “Y-yes,” squeaked Hermione. “Good, you’ll do perfectly well.” Umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold. “That’s that problem solved, Minister, if Ma-falda  can  be  spared  for  record-keeping  we  shall  be  able  to  start straightaway.”  She  consulted  her  clipboard.  “Ten  people  today and  one  of  them  the  wife  of  a  Ministry  employee!  Tut,  tut  .  .  . even  here,  in  the  heart  of  the  Ministry!”  She  stepped  into  the  lift beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had been listening to  Umbridge’s  conversation  with  the  Minister.  “We’ll  go  straight down, Mafalda, you’ll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, aren’t you getting out?” “Yes, of course,” said Harry in Runcorn’s deep voice. Harry  stepped  out  of  the  lift.  The  golden  grilles  clanged  shut behind  him.  Glancing  over  his  shoulder,  Harry  saw  Hermione’s (cid:145) 246 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge’s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. “What brings you up here, Runcorn?” asked the new Minister of Magic. His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a  great  overhanging  forehead  shadowed  his  glinting  eyes,  putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock. “Needed a quick word with,” Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, “Arthur Weasley. Someone said he was up on level one.” “Ah,” said Pius Thicknesse. “Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?” “No,” said Harry, his throat dry. “No, nothing like that.” “Ah,  well.  It’s  only  a  matter  of  time,”  said  Thicknesse.  “If  you ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.” “Good day, Minister.” Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The moment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction.  Runcorn  was  so  tall  that  Harry  was  forced  to  stoop  to make sure his big feet were hidden. Panic  pulsed  in  the  pit  of  his  stomach.  As  he  passed  gleaming wooden  door  after  gleaming  wooden  door,  each  bearing  a  small plaque with the owner’s name and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish.  They  had  concentrated  all  their  efforts  on  getting  inside without being detected: They had not given a moment’s thought to (cid:145) 247 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTEEN what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermi-one was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours;  Ron  was  struggling  to  do  magic  that  Harry  was  sure  was beyond him, a woman’s liberty possibly depending on the outcome; and  he,  Harry,  was  wandering  around  on  the  top  floor  when  he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift. He  stopped  walking,  leaned  against  a  wall,  and  tried  to  decide what to do. The silence pressed upon him: There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here; the purple-carpeted corridors were as  hushed  as  though  the  Muffliato  charm  had  been  cast  over  the place. Her office must be up here, Harry thought. It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off along the corridor again, pass-ing  nobody  but  a  frowning  wizard  who  was  murmuring  instruc-tions to a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment. Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direc-tion  like  little  pink  kites.  After  a  few  seconds,  Harry  realized  that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the same pattern; and after a few more seconds he realized that what he  was  watching  was  the  creation  of  pamphlets  —  that  the  paper (cid:145) 248 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION squares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title: MUDBLOODS and the Dangers They Pose to a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in  the  middle  of  its  petals,  being  strangled  by  a  green  weed  with fangs and a scowl. There was no author’s name upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her wand, “Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?” “Careful,” said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor. “What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?” The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and rage reared in him like a snake. Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had been  set  into  the  wood  —  an  eye  that  was  shockingly  familiar  to anybody who had known Alastor Moody. For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was (cid:145) 249 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTEEN doing there: He even forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over  to  the  door  to  examine  the  eye. It  was  not moving:  It  gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read:  Dolores Umbridge Senior Undersecretary to the Minister  Below that, a slightly shinier new plaque read:  Head of the Muggle-born Registration Commission  Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were intent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground. It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wiz-ards  in  front  of  him.  A  few  moments  later,  during  which  Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner. The young witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Um-bridge’s office, and closed the door behind him. He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge’s  office  at  Hogwarts:  Lace  draperies,  doilies,  and  dried flowers  covered  every  available  surface.  The  walls  bore  the  same (cid:145) 250 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kit-ten, gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness. The desk was covered  with  a  flouncy,  flowered  cloth.  Behind  Mad-Eye’s  eye,  a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on the  other  side  of  the  door.  Harry took  a look through it  and saw that  they  were  all  still  gathered  around  the  Decoy  Detonator.  He wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. Then he turned  to  face  the  room  again,  raised  his  wand,  and  murmured, “Accio Locket.” Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Um-bridge  knew  all  about  protective  charms  and  spells.  He  therefore hurried  behind  her  desk  and  began  pulling  open  the  drawers.  He saw  quills  and  notebooks  and  Spellotape;  enchanted  paper  clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign of a locket. There was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to search-ing it. Like Filch’s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of fold-ers, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his search: Mr. Weasley’s file. He pulled it out and opened it. ARTHUR WEASLEY blood status: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle leanings. Known member of the Order of the Phoenix.

NB: Youngest son currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have confirmed. security status:  TRACKED. All movements are being monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will contact (has stayed with Weasley family previously) “Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster  of  himself  on  the  wall,  with  the  words  undesirable  no.  1 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and saw that Umbridge had written, “To be punished.” Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the office one last sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk. Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all. Dumble-dore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book. Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat — The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore — nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest: “by Rita Skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?” (cid:145) 252 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION Harry  opened  the  book  at  random  and  saw  a  full-page  photo-graph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their arms around each other’s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum’s chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in si-lent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a young Doge, but before he could check the caption, the door of the office opened. If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he en-tered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he remained quite  still,  staring  curiously  at  the  place  where  Harry  had  just vanished.  Perhaps  deciding  that  all  he  had  seen  was  Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily replaced  it  upon  the  shelf,  Thicknesse  finally  walked  to  the  desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly  daring  to  breathe,  Harry  backed  out  of  the  office  into  the open area beyond. The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they’re so careless, remember that poisonous duck?” Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while (cid:145) 253 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTEEN she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to be to leave the Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another day. The first thing to do was to find Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom. The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak as it started its descent. To his enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-eyed Ron got in. “M-morning,” he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again. “Ron, it’s me, Harry!” “Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like — why isn’t Her-mione with you?” “She  had  to  go  down  to  the  courtrooms  with  Umbridge,  she couldn’t refuse, and —” But  before  Harry  could  finish  the  lift  had  stopped  again:  The doors  opened  and  Mr.  Weasley  walked  inside,  talking  to  an  el-derly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill. “. . . I quite understand what you’re saying, Wakanda, but I’m afraid I cannot be party to —” Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have Mr. Weasley glare at him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more. “Oh, hello, Reg,” said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady dripping from Ron’s robes. “Isn’t your wife in for question-ing today? Er — what’s happened to you? Why are you so wet?” “Yaxley’s office is raining,” said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley’s shoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might rec-ognize him if they looked directly into each other’s eyes. “I couldn’t (cid:145) 254 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION stop it, so they’ve sent me to get Bernie — Pillsworth, I think they said —” “Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,” said Mr. Weasley. “Did you try Meteolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.” “Meteolojinx Recanto?” whispered Ron. “No, I didn’t. Thanks, D — I mean, thanks, Arthur.” The  lift  doors  opened;  the  old  witch  with  the  anthill  hair  left, and Ron darted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his nose buried in some papers he was reading. Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lift with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm. “One moment, Runcorn.” The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weasley said, “I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.” Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley’s anger was no less because of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid. “Sorry?” he said. “Don’t pretend, Runcorn,” said Mr. Weasley fiercely. “You tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn’t you?” “I — so what if I did?” said Harry. “So  Dirk  Cresswell  is  ten  times  the  wizard  you  are,”  said  Mr. Weasley quietly, as the lift sank ever lower. “And if he survives Az-kaban, you’ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons, and his friends —” (cid:145) 255 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTEEN “Arthur,”  Harry  interrupted,  “you  know  you’re  being  tracked, “Is that a threat, Runcorn?” said Mr. Weasley loudly. “No,”  said  Harry,  “it’s  a  fact!  They’re  watching  your  every don’t you?” move —” The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave  Harry  a  scathing  look  and  swept  from  the  lift.  Harry  stood there,  shaken.  He  wished  he  was  impersonating  somebody  other than Runcorn. . . . The lift doors clanged shut. Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try to extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining office. When the doors opened, he stepped out into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the wood-paneled and carpeted corridors above. As the lift rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries. He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. His mind grappled with pos-sibilities  as  he  crept  down  them:  He  still  had  a  couple  of  Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with Mafalda?  Of  course,  he  did  not  know  whether  Runcorn  was  suf-ficiently important to get away with this, and even if he managed it, Hermione’s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they were clear of the Ministry. . . . Lost  in  thought,  he  did  not  immediately  register  the  unnatural chill that was creeping over him, as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took: a cold (cid:145) 256 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION that reached right down into his throat and tore at his lungs. And then  he  felt  that  stealing  sense  of  despair,  of  hopelessness,  filling him, expanding inside him. . . . Dementors, he thought. And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black-hooded figures, their faces completely hid-den, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their faces in their hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from  the  dementors’  greedy  mouths.  Some  were  accompanied  by families, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding up and down in front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse. . . . Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a  Patronus  here  without  revealing  himself  instantly.  So  he  moved forward as silently as he could, and with every step he took numb-ness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him. Moving  through  the  towering  black  figures  was  terrifying:  The eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence that still had some hope, some resilience. . . . And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it. “No, no, I’m half-blood, I’m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard, he was, look him up, Arkie Alderton, he’s a well-known (cid:145) 257 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTEEN broomstick designer, look him up, I tell you — get your hands off me, get your hands off —” “This is your final warning,” said  Umbridge’s  soft  voice,  magi-cally magnified so that it sounded clearly over the man’s desperate screams. “If you struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor’s Kiss.” The  man’s  screams  subsided,  but  dry  sobs  echoed  through  the corridor. “Take him away,” said Umbridge. Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting,  scabbed  hands  clutching  the  upper  arms  of  a  wizard  who appeared to be fainting. They glided away down the corridor with him,  and  the  darkness  they  trailed  behind  them  swallowed  him from sight. “Next — Mary Cattermole,” called Umbridge. A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot. Her  dark  hair  was  smoothed  back  into  a  bun  and  she  wore  long, plain  robes.  Her  face  was  completely  bloodless.  As  she  passed  the dementors, Harry saw her shudder. He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her. It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic. This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well. There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners far-thest from the high, raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade, sat (cid:145) 258 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, quite as white-faced  as  Mrs.  Cattermole,  on  the  other.  At  the  foot  of  the platform, a bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was there to protect the pros-ecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors: That was for the accused to feel, not the accusers. “Sit down,” said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice. Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there. “You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?” asked Umbridge. Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod. “Married  to  Reginald  Cattermole  of  the  Magical  Maintenance Department?” Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears. “I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!” Umbridge ignored her. “Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?” Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever. “They’re frightened, they think I might not come home —” “Spare us,” spat Yaxley. “The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies.” Mrs. Cattermole’s sobs masked Harry’s footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat patrolled, he felt the change in temperature: It was warm and comfortable here. The Patronus, he was sure, was Umbridge’s, and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here, in her element, upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. Slowly and very carefully he edged (cid:145) 259 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTEEN his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermi-one, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making Hermione jump. He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm. Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance. “I’m behind you,” he whispered into Hermione’s ear. As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed. “A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today,  Mrs.  Cattermole,”  Umbridge  was  saying.  “Eight-and-three-quarter  inches,  cherry,  unicorn-hair  core.  Do  you  recognize  that description?” Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve. “Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?” “T-took?” sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. “I didn’t t-take it from any-body. I b-bought it when I was eleven years old. It — it — it — chose me.” She cried harder than ever. Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her  victim,  and  something  gold  swung  forward  too,  and  dangled over the void: the locket. Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and  Yaxley,  still  intent  upon  their  prey,  were  deaf  to  everything else. (cid:145) 260 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION “No,”  said  Umbridge,  “no,  I  don’t  think  so,  Mrs.  Cattermole. Wands only choose witches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your  responses  to  the  questionnaire  that  was  sent  to  you  here  — Mafalda, pass them to me.” Umbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that moment that Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermione’s hands were shaking with shock. She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her, finally  withdrawing  a  sheaf  of  parchment  with  Mrs.  Cattermole’s name on it. “That’s — that’s pretty, Dolores,” she said, pointing at the pen-dant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge’s blouse. “What?” snapped Umbridge, glancing down. “Oh yes — an old family heirloom,” she said, patting the locket lying on her large bo-som. “The S stands for Selwyn. . . . I am related to the Selwyns. . . . Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related. . . . A pity,” she continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole’s questionnaire, “that the same cannot be said for you. ‘Parents’ professions: greengrocers.’ ” Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners. It was Umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry’s brain  and  obliterated  his  sense  of  caution  —  that  the  locket  she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bol-ster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not even troubling  to  keep  it  concealed  beneath  the  Invisibility  Cloak,  and said, “Stupefy!” There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her fore-head  hit  the  edge  of  the  balustrade:  Mrs.  Cattermole’s  papers  slid (cid:145) 261 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTEEN off her lap onto the floor and, down below, the prowling silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: Yaxley, con-fused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry’s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: “Stupefy!” Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. “Harry!” “Hermione,  if  you  think  I  was  going  to  sit  here  and  let  her pretend —” “Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!” Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below,  the  dementors  had  moved  out  of  their  corners;  they  were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back. “EXPECTO PATRONUM!” The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry’s wand and leaped toward  the  dementors,  which  fell  back  and  melted  into  the  dark shadows again. The stag’s light, more powerful and more warming than  the  cat’s  protection,  filled  the  whole  dungeon  as  it  cantered around and around the room. “Get the Horcrux,” Harry told Hermione. He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak back into his bag, and approached Mrs. Cattermole. “You?” she whispered, gazing into his face. “But — but Reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning!” “Did I?” muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms. (cid:145) 262 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION “Well,  I’ve  had  a  change  of  heart.  Diffindo!”  Nothing  happened. “Hermione, how do I get rid of these chains?” “Wait, I’m trying something up here —” “Hermione, we’re surrounded by dementors!” “I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket’s gone — I need to duplicate it — Geminio! There . . . That should fool her. . . .” Hermione came running downstairs. “Let’s see. . . . Relashio!” The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before. “I don’t understand,” she whispered. “You’re going to leave here with us,” said Harry, pulling her to her feet. “Go home, grab your children, and get out, get out of the country if you’ve got to. Disguise yourselves and run. You’ve seen how it is, you won’t get anything like a fair hearing here.” “Harry,” said Hermione, “how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door?” “Patronuses,” said Harry, pointing his wand at his own: The stag slowed  and  walked,  still  gleaming  brightly,  toward  the  door.  “As many as we can muster; do yours, Hermione.” “Expec  —  Expecto  patronum,”  said  Hermione.  Nothing  hap-pened. “It’s the only spell she ever has trouble with,” Harry told a com-pletely bemused Mrs. Cattermole. “Bit unfortunate, really . . . Come on, Hermione. . . .” “Expecto patronum!” A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione’s wand and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag. (cid:145) 263 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTEEN “C’mon,” said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door. When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside. Harry looked around; the dementors  were  falling  back  on  both  sides  of  them,  melding  into the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures. “It’s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families,” Harry told the waiting Muggle-borns, who were dazzled  by  the  light  of  the  Patronuses  and  still  cowering  slightly. “Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That’s the — er — new official position. Now, if you’ll just follow the Pa-tronuses, you’ll be able to leave from the Atrium.” They managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted, but as they approached the lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them. “Reg!”  screamed  Mrs.  Cattermole,  and  she  threw  herself  into Ron’s arms. “Runcorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he’s told all of us to leave the country, I think we’d better do it, Reg, I really do, let’s hurry home and fetch the children and — why are you so wet?” “Water,” muttered Ron, disengaging himself. “Harry, they know there are intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge’s office door, I reckon we’ve got five minutes if that —” Hermione’s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror-struck face to Harry. (cid:145) 264 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION “Harry, if we’re trapped here — !” “We won’t be if we move fast,” said Harry. He addressed the silent group behind them, who were all gawping at him. “Who’s got wands?” About half of them raised their hands. “Okay, all of you who haven’t got wands need to attach yourself to  somebody  who  has.  We’ll  need  to  be  fast  before  they  stop  us. Come on.” They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry’s Patro-nus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise. “Level eight,” said the witch’s cool voice, “Atrium.” Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off. “Harry!” squeaked Hermione. “What are we going to — ?” “STOP!” Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed  through  the  Atrium:  The  wizards  sealing  the  fireplaces froze. “Follow me,” he whispered to the group of terrified Muggle-borns,  who  moved  forward  in  a  huddle,  shepherded  by  Ron  and Hermione. “What’s up, Albert?” said the same balding wizard who had fol-lowed Harry out of the fireplace earlier. He looked nervous. “This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,” said Harry with all the authority he could muster. The group of wizards in front of him looked at one another. “We’ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone —” “Are you contradicting me?” Harry blustered. “Would you like me to have your family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell’s?” “Sorry!” gasped the balding wizard, backing away. “I didn’t mean (cid:145) 265 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTEEN nothing, Albert, but I thought . . . I thought they were in for ques-tioning and . . .” “Their blood is pure,” said Harry, and his deep voice echoed im-pressively  through  the  hall.  “Purer than  many  of  yours,  I  daresay. Off you go,” he boomed to the Muggle-borns, who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wiz-ards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and resent-ful. Then: “Mary!” Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Catter-mole, no longer vomiting but pale and wan, had just come running out of a lift. “R-Reg?” She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly. The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other. “Hey — what’s going on? What is this?” “Seal the exit! SEAL IT!” Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces, into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs.  Cattermole  had  now  vanished.  As  the  balding  wizard  lifted his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, sending him flying through the air. “He’s  been  helping  Muggle-borns  escape,  Yaxley!”  Harry shouted. The balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry to   (cid:145) 266 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION  COMMISSION the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed, “My wife! Who was that with my wife? What’s going on?” Harry saw Yaxley’s head turn, saw an inkling of the truth dawn in that brutish face. “Come on!” Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed over Harry’s head. They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door; Ron was standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole. “Reg, I don’t understand —” “Let go, I’m not your husband, you’ve got to go home!” There  was  a  noise  in  the  cubicle  behind  them;  Harry  looked around; Yaxley had just appeared. “LET’S  GO!”  Harry  yelled.  He  seized  Hermione  by  the  hand and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot. Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing bands, but something was wrong. . . . Hermione’s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip. . . . He  wondered  whether  he  was  going  to  suffocate;  he  could  not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were Ron’s arm and Hermione’s fingers, which were slowly slipping away. . . . And then he saw the door of number twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent door knocker, but before he could draw breath, there was a scream and a flash of purple light; Hermione’s hand was sud-denly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again. (cid:145) 267 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  F O U R T E E N  THE THIEF    H arry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; he had no idea what had happened, he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. Struggling to draw  breath  into  lungs  that  felt  flattened,  he  blinked  and  realized that  the  gaudy  glare  was  sunlight  streaming  through  a  canopy  of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face. He pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small, fierce  creature,  but  saw  that  the  object  was  Ron’s  foot.  Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone. Harry’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a mo-ment, even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid’s hut. How-ever, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the (cid:145) 268 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  THIEF Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer. He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron’s head. The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry’s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron’s left side and his face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left. “What’s happened to him?” “Splinched,”  said  Hermione,  her  fingers  already  busy  at  Ron’s sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest. Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron’s shirt. He had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this . . . His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron’s up-per arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife. “Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany’ —” “Bag — right —” Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his touch: He felt the leather spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes — “Quickly!” He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag. “Accio Dittany!” A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and (cid:145) 269 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOURTEEN hastened  back  to  Hermione  and  Ron,  whose  eyes  were  now  half-closed, strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids. “He’s fainted,” said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places. “Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.” Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish  smoke  billowed  upward  and  when  it  had  cleared,  Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh. “Wow,” said Harry. “It’s all I feel safe doing,” said Hermione shakily. “There are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren’t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage. . . . He’s lost so much blood already. . . .” “How did he get hurt? I mean” — Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make sense of whatever had just taken place — “why are we here? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place?” Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears. “Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to go back there.” “What d’you — ?” “As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn’t get rid of him, he was too strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then — well, I think he must have  seen  the  door,  and  thought  we  were  stopping  there,  so  he slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead!” “But then, where’s he? Hang on. . . . You don’t mean he’s at Grim-mauld Place? He can’t get in there?” (cid:145) 270 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  THIEF Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded. “Harry, I think he can. I — I forced him to let go with a Revul-sion  Jinx,  but  I’d  already  taken  him  inside  the  Fidelius  Charm’s protection.  Since  Dumbledore  died,  we’re  Secret-Keepers,  so  I’ve given him the secret, haven’t I?” There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was no  way  that  they  could  return.  Even  now,  he  could  be  bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge: even, now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined  the  house-elf  busying  himself  over  the  steak-and-kidney pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat. “Harry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” “Don’t  be  stupid,  it  wasn’t  your  fault!  If  anything,  it  was mine. . . .” Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye’s eye. Hermione recoiled, looking horrified. “Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn’t leave it there . . . but that’s how they knew there were intruders.” Before  Hermione  could  answer,  Ron  groaned  and  opened  his eyes. He was still gray and his face glistened with sweat. “How d’you feel?” Hermione whispered. “Lousy,” croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. “Where are we?” “In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,” said Hermione.  “I  wanted  somewhere  enclosed,  undercover,  and  this was —” (cid:145) 271 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOURTEEN “— the first place you thought of,” Harry finished for her, glanc-ing around at the apparently deserted glade. He could not help re-membering what had happened the last time they had Apparated to  the  first  place  Hermione  had  thought  of  —  how  Death  Eaters had  found  them  within  minutes.  Had  it  been  Legilimency?  Did Voldemort or his henchmen know, even now, where Hermione had taken them? “D’you  reckon  we  should  move  on?”  Ron  asked  Harry,  and Harry could tell by the look on Ron’s face that he was thinking the same. “I dunno.” Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting. “Let’s stay here for now,” Harry said. Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet. “Where are you going?” asked Ron. “If  we’re  staying,  we  should  put  some  protective  enchantments around the place,” she replied, and raising her wand, she began to  walk  in  a  wide  circle  around  Harry  and  Ron,  murmuring  in-cantations  as  she  went.  Harry  saw  little  disturbances  in  the  sur-rounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. “Salvio  Hexia  .  .  .  Protego  Totalum  .  .  .  Repello  Muggletum  .  .  . Muffliato . . . You could get out the tent, Harry. . . .” “Tent?” “In the bag!” “In the . . . of course,” said Harry. He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another (cid:145) 272 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  THIEF Summoning Charm. The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, rope, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup. “I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?” he asked, starting to disentangle the tent pegs. “Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so bad,” said Hermione, now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand, “so Ron’s dad said I could borrow it. Erecto!” she added,  pointing  her  wand  at  the  misshapen  canvas,  which  in  one fluid motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before Harry, out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope. “Cave  Inimicum,”  Hermione  finished  with  a  skyward  flourish. “That’s  as  much  as  I  can  do.  At  the  very  least,  we  should  know they’re coming, I can’t guarantee it will keep out Vol —” “Don’t say the name!” Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. Harry and Hermione looked at each other. “I’m sorry,” Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, “but it feels like a — a jinx or something. Can’t we call him You-Know-Who — please?” “Dumbledore said fear of a name —” began Harry. “In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn’t do Dumbledore much good in the end,” Ron snapped back. “Just — just show You-Know-Who some respect, will you?” “Respect?”  Harry  repeated,  but  Hermione  shot  him  a  warning look; apparently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition. Harry  and  Hermione  half  carried,  half  dragged  Ron  through (cid:145) 273 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOURTEEN the entrance of the tent. The interior was exactly as Harry remem-bered it: a small flat, complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved  aside  an  old  armchair  and  lowered  Ron  carefully  onto  the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while. “I’ll make some tea,” said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen. Harry  found  the  hot  drink  as  welcome  as  the  firewhisky  had been on the night that Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After a minute or two, Ron broke the silence. “What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?” “With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for comfort. “As long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he’ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by Side-Along-Apparition and they’ll be fleeing the country right now with their children. That’s what Harry told her to do.” “Blimey,  I  hope  they  escaped,”  said  Ron,  leaning  back  on  his pillows. The tea seemed to be doing him good; a little of his color had returned. “I didn’t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they made it. . . . If they both end up in Az-kaban because of us . . .” Harry  looked  over  at  Hermione  and  the  question  he  had  been about  to  ask  —  about  whether  Mrs.  Cattermole’s  lack  of  a  wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband — died in his throat.  Hermione  was  watching  Ron  fret  over  the  fate  of  the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that (cid:145) 274 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  THIEF Harry  felt  almost  as  if  he  had  surprised  her  in  the  act  of  kissing him. “So, have you got it?” Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there. the locket?” “Got — got what?” she said with a little start. “What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where’s “You got it?” shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows. “No one tells me anything! Blimey, you could have men-tioned it!” “Well,  we  were  running  for  our  lives  from  the  Death  Eaters, weren’t we?” said Hermione. “Here.” And  she  pulled  the  locket  out  of  the  pocket  of  her  robes  and handed it to Ron. It was as large as a chicken’s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green stones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent’s canvas roof. “There  isn’t  any  chance  someone’s  destroyed  it  since  Kreacher had  it?”  asked  Ron  hopefully.  “I  mean,  are  we  sure  it’s  still  a Horcrux?” “I think so,” said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. “There’d be some sign of damage if it had been magi-cally destroyed.” She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked  perfect,  pristine.  He  remembered  the  mangled  remains  of the diary, and how the stone in the Horcrux ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it. “I reckon Kreacher’s right,” said Harry. “We’re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.” (cid:145) 275 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOURTEEN Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the  little  golden  doors,  hit  Harry  as  he  spoke.  Even  after  all  their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with his fingers,  then  attempted  the  charm  Hermione  had  used  to  open Regulus’s  bedroom  door.  Neither  worked.  He  handed  the  locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been. “Can  you  feel  it,  though?”  Ron  asked  in  a  hushed  voice,  as  he held it tight in his clenched fist. “What d’you mean?” Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing through  his  veins  that  he  could  feel,  or  was  it  something  beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart? “What are we going to do with it?” Hermione asked. “Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it,” Harry replied, and, little though he wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him. “I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,” he added to Hermione, standing up and stretching. “And we’ll need to think about some food as well. You stay there,” he added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green. With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birth-day set carefully upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent  the  rest  of  the  day  sharing  the  role  of  lookout.  However, the  Sneakoscope  remained  silent  and  still  upon  its  point  all  day, and whether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle-(cid:145) 276 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  THIEF repelling  charms  Hermione  had  spread  around  them,  or  because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained de-serted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten o’clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing. He  felt  hungry  now,  and  a  little  light-headed.  Hermione  had not packed any food in her magical bag, as she had assumed that they  would  be  returning  to  Grimmauld  Place  that  night,  so  they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermi-one had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt Hermione’s feelings. The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded  like  crackings  of  twigs:  Harry  thought  that  they  were caused  by  animals  rather  than  people,  yet  he  kept  his  wand  held tight at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled with unease. He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat look-ing out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt halt, run out of road. There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest idea where they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. Meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to (cid:145) 277 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOURTEEN destroy  the  only  one  that  they  had  found,  the  Horcrux  that  cur-rently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry thought, or  perhaps  imagined,  that  he  could  feel  the  tiny  heartbeat  ticking irregularly alongside his own. Nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark: He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came at him relent-lessly. Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: He could not. And it  seemed to Harry as he sat there trying  to  master  his  own  fear  and  exhaustion,  that  the  Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left. . . . Stupid idea, he told himself, don’t think that. . . . His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was making  it  happen  by  having  these  thoughts,  and  tried  to  direct them into another channel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would the elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick im-ages swarmed into Harry’s head and he tried to push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher: He and Hermione had already decided against trying to summon him; what if some-one  from  the  Ministry  came  too?  They  could  not  count  on  elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione’s sleeve. Harry’s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much (cid:145) 278 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  THIEF they  did  not  know:  Lupin  had  been  right  about  magic  they  had never encountered or imagined. Why hadn’t Dumbledore explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he would live for years, for centuries perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong. . . . Snape had seen to that. . . . Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower . . . And Dumbledore had fallen . . . fallen . . . “Give it to me, Gregorovitch.” Harry’s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by a long-fingered white hand. The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his  limbs  wrapped  about  him,  his  terrified  face,  on  a  level  with Harry’s,  ruddy  due  to  the  blood  that  had  rushed  to  his  head.  He had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard: a trussed-up Father Christmas. “I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen from me!” “Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows. . . . He always knows.” The hanging man’s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole — And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch’s wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in  the  swinging  pool  of  light,  and  there  on  the  window  ledge  sat perched,  like  a  giant  bird,  a  young  man  with  golden  hair.  In  the (cid:145) 279 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOURTEEN split second that the lantern’s light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a crow of laughter. And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils and Gregorovitch’s face was stricken with terror. “Who was the thief, Gregorovitch?” said the high cold voice. “I do not know, I never knew, a young man — no — please — PLEASE!” A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light — “Harry!” He  opened  his  eyes,  panting,  his  forehead  throbbing.  He  had passed out against the side of the tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. He looked up at Hermi-one, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high above them. “Dream,”  he  said,  sitting  up  quickly  and  attempting  to  meet Hermione’s glower with a look of innocence. “Must’ve dozed off, sorry.” “I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were looking into Vol —” “Don’t say his name!” came Ron’s angry voice from the depths of the tent. “Fine,” retorted Hermione. “You-Know-Who’s mind, then!” “I didn’t mean it to happen!” Harry said. “It was a dream! Can you control what you dream about, Hermione?” “If you just learned to apply Occlumency —” But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to dis-cuss what he had just seen. (cid:145) 280 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  THIEF “He’s  found  Gregorovitch,  Hermione,  and  I  think  he’s  killed him, but before he killed him he  read Gregorovitch’s mind and I saw —” “I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re falling asleep,” said Hermione coldly. “I can finish the watch!” “No, you’re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.” She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside. Ron’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the one above him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After several moments, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the entrance. “What’s You-Know-Who doing?” Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered into the darkness. “He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.” “How’s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he’s tied up?” “I dunno. . . . It’s weird, isn’t it?” Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all he had seen and heard. The more  he  recalled,  the  less  sense  it  made.  .  .  .  Voldemort  had  said nothing about Harry’s wand, nothing about the twin cores, noth-ing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat Harry’s. . . . “He wanted something from Gregorovitch,” Harry said, eyes still closed tight. “He asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him . . . and then . . . then . . .” (cid:145) 281 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FOURTEEN He  remembered  how  he,  as  Voldemort,  had  seemed  to  hurtle through Gregorovitch’s eyes, into his memories. . . . “He read Gregorovitch’s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he stole whatever You-Know-Who’s after. And I . . . I think I’ve seen him somewhere. . . .” Harry  wished  he  could  have  another  glimpse  of  the  laughing boy’s  face.  The  theft  had  happened  many  years  ago,  according  to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look familiar? The  noises  of  the  surrounding  woods  were  muffled  inside  the tent; all Harry could hear was Ron’s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, “Couldn’t you see what the thief was holding?” “No . . . it must’ve been something small.” “Harry?” The wooden slats of Ron’s bunk creaked as he repositioned him-self in bed. “Harry, you don’t reckon You-Know-Who’s after something else to turn into a Horcrux?” “I don’t know,” said Harry slowly. “Maybe. But wouldn’t it be dangerous for him to make another one? Didn’t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?” “Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that.” “Yeah . . . maybe,” said Harry. He  had  been  sure  that  Voldemort  had  been  looking  for  a  way around the problem of the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker . . . and yet he had killed him, apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore. What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the Wizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent (cid:145) 282 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  THIEF on the pursuit of an object that Gregorovitch had once owned, and which had been stolen by the unknown thief? Harry could still see the blond-haired youth’s face; it was merry, wild;  there  was  a  Fred  and  George-ish  air  of  triumphant  trickery about  him.  He  had  soared  from  the  windowsill  like  a  bird,  and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. . . . With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and it was on him that Harry’s thoughts dwelled, as Ron’s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more. (cid:145) 283 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  F I F T E E N THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE    E arly next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye Moody’s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge’s door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next. Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore re-moved the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry  and  Ron  obliterated  all  the  marks  and  impressions  on  the ground that might show they had camped there. Then they Disap-parated to the outskirts of a small market town. Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of (cid:145) 284 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE trees  and  surrounded  it  with  freshly  cast  defensive  enchantments, Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This,  however,  did  not  go  as  planned.  He  had  barely  entered  the town  when  an  unnatural  chill,  a  descending  mist,  and  a  sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood. “But  you  can  make  a  brilliant  Patronus!”  protested  Ron,  when Harry  arrived  back  at  the  tent  empty-handed,  out  of  breath,  and mouthing the single word, dementors. “I couldn’t . . . make one,” he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. “Wouldn’t . . . come.” Their  expressions  of  consternation  and  disappointment  made Harry  feel  ashamed.  It  had  been  a  nightmarish  experience,  seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, as  the  paralyzing  cold  choked  his  lungs  and  a  distant  screaming filled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry’s willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who  might  not  be  able  to  see  them,  but  would  assuredly  feel  the despair they cast wherever they went. “So we still haven’t got any food.” “Shut  up,  Ron,”  snapped  Hermione.  “Harry,  what  happened? Why do you think you couldn’t make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!” “I don’t know.” He sat low in one of Perkins’s old armchairs, feeling more humili-ated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago: Today he might have been  thirteen  years  old  again,  the  only  one  who  collapsed  on  the Hogwarts Express. (cid:145) 285 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN Ron kicked a chair leg. “What?” he snarled at Hermione. “I’m starving! All I’ve had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!” “You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,” said Harry, stung. “I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed!” ‘“That’s convenient.” “And what’s that supposed to — ?” “Of  course!”  cried  Hermione,  clapping  a  hand  to  her  forehead and startling both of them into silence. “Harry, give me the locket! Come on,” she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not react, “the Horcrux, Harry, you’re still wearing it!” She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his  head.  The  moment  it  parted  contact  with  Harry’s  skin  he  felt free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted. “Better?” asked Hermione. “Yeah, loads better!” “Harry,” she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind  of  voice  he  associated  with visiting the very sick, “you don’t think you’ve been possessed, do you?” “What? No!” he said defensively. “I remember everything we’ve done while I’ve been wearing it. I wouldn’t know what I’d done if I’d been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn’t remember anything.” “Hmm,” said Hermione, looking down at the heavy gold locket. “Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent.” (cid:145) 286 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE “We  are  not  leaving  that  Horcrux  lying  around,”  Harry  stated firmly. “If we lose it, if it gets stolen —” “Oh, all right, all right,” said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. “But we’ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.” “Great,” said Ron irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that out, can we please get some food?” “Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said Hermione with half  a  glance  at  Harry.  “There’s  no  point  staying  where  we  know dementors are swooping around.” In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field be-longing to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread. “It’s not stealing, is it?” asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. “Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?” Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, “ ’Er-my-nee, ’oo worry ’oo much. ’Elax!” And, indeed, it was much easier  to  relax  when  they  were  com-fortably well fed: The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches. This was their first encounter with the fact  that  a full stomach meant  good  spirits;  an  empty  one,  bickering  and  gloom.  Harry was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation  at  the  Dursleys’.  Hermione  bore  up  reasonably  well  on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three (cid:145) 287 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN delicious  meals  a  day,  courtesy  of  his  mother  or  of  the  Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron’s turn to wear the Hor-crux, he became downright unpleasant. “So  where  next?”  was  his  constant  refrain.  He  did  not  seem  to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly  Harry  and  Hermione  spent  fruitless  hours  trying  to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to de-stroy  the  one  they  had  already  got,  their  conversations  becoming increasingly repetitive as they had no new information. As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept recit-ing, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Volde-mort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and  raised;  Hogwarts,  where  he  had  been  educated;  Borgin  and Burkes, where he had worked after completing school; then Alba-nia, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis of their speculations. “Yeah, let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,” said Ron sarcastically. “There  can’t  be  anything  there.  He’d  already  made  five  of  his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,” said Hermione. “We know the snake’s not in Albania, it’s usually with Vol —” “Didn’t I ask you to stop saying that?” “Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who — happy?” “Not particularly.” “I  can’t  see  him  hiding  anything  at  Borgin  and  Burkes,”  said (cid:145) 288 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE Harry, who had made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. “Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would’ve recognized a Horcrux straightaway.” Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw some-thing at him, Harry plowed on, “I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts.” Hermione sighed. “But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!” Harry  repeated  the  argument  he  kept  bringing  out  in  favor  of this theory. “Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwarts’s secrets. I’m telling you, if there was one place Vol —” “Oi!” “YOU-KNOW-WHO,  then!”  Harry  shouted,  goaded  past  en-durance. “If there was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!” “Oh, come on,” scoffed Ron. “His school?” “Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left —” “This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right? Not you?” inquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him. “You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left,” said Hermione. “That’s right,” said Harry. “And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and  find  something,  probably  another  founder’s  object,  to  make into another Horcrux?” (cid:145) 289 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN “Yeah,” said Harry. “But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he never got  the  chance  to  find  a  founder’s  object  there  and  hide  it  in  the school!” “Okay, then,” said Harry, defeated. “Forget Hogwarts.” Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and dis-covered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before. They visited its site and found a tower block of offices. “We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested halfheartedly. “He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here,” Harry said. He had known it all along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of  his  soul  there.  Dumbledore  had  shown  Harry  that  Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner  of  London  was  as  far  removed  as  you  could  imagine  from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizard-ing bank, with its golden doors and marble floors. Even  without  any  new  ideas,  they  continued  to  move  through the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and se-cluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices  of  cliffs,  to  purple  moors,  gorse-covered  mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded (cid:145) 290 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety. Harry’s scar kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when  he  was  wearing  the  Horcrux.  Sometimes  he  could  not  stop himself reacting to the pain. “What? What did you see?” demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince. “A face,” muttered Harry, every time. “The same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.” And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disap-pointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Ap-parently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry’s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when they were so desper-ate for a lead on the Horcruxes. As  the  days  stretched  into  weeks,  Harry  began  to  suspect  that Ron and Hermione were having conversations without, and about, him.  Several  times  they  stopped  talking  abruptly  when  Harry  en-tered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a  little  distance  away,  heads  together  and  talking  fast;  both  times they  fell  silent  when  they  realized  he  was  approaching  them  and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water. (cid:145) 291 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey be-cause they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it. Autumn  rolled  over  the  countryside  as  they  moved  through  it: They were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at iden-tifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their con-tinuing isolation, the lack of other people’s company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort. “My mother,” said Ron one night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, “can make good food appear out of thin air.” He  prodded  moodily  at  the  lumps  of  charred  gray  fish  on  his plate.  Harry  glanced  automatically  at  Ron’s  neck  and  saw,  as  he had expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket. “Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione. “No  one  can.  Food  is  the  first  of the  five  Principal  Exceptions  to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfigur —” “Oh, speak English, can’t you?” Ron said, prising a fish bone out from between his teeth. (cid:145) 292 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE “It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Sum-mon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you’ve already got some —” “Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting,” said Ron. “Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I’m al-ways the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I’m a girl, I suppose!” “No, it’s because you’re supposed to be the best at magic!” shot back Ron. onto the floor. Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate “You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingre-dients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you —” “Shut up!” said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. “Shut up now!” Hermione looked outraged. “How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook —” “Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!” He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving. “You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?” he whispered to Hermione. “I  did  everything,”  she  whispered  back,  “Muffliato,  Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn’t be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.” Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged (cid:145) 293 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN stones  and  twigs,  told  them  that  several  people  were  clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be suf-ficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of  Muggles  and  normal  witches  and  wizards.  If  these  were  Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time. The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance. Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice. “There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d’you reckon it’s too early in the season? Accio Salmon!” There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river  he  could  make  out  more  voices,  but  they  were  not  speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and  unmelodious  tongue,  a  string  of  rattling,  guttural  noises,  and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other. A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large shad-ows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking (cid:145) 294 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the clink-ing of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again. “Here, Griphook, Gornuk.” Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. “Thank you,” said the goblins together in English. “So,  you  three  have  been  on  the  run  how  long?”  asked  a  new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man. “Six weeks . . . seven . . . I forget,” said the tired man. “Met up with  Griphook  in  the  first  couple  of  days  and  joined  forces  with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.” There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. “What made you leave, Ted?” contin-ued the man. “Knew they were coming for me,” replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry  suddenly  knew  who  he  was:  Tonks’s  father.  “Heard  Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I’d better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I’d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she’s pure-blood. And then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?” “Yeah,” said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor. “Muggle-born, eh?” asked the first man. “Not sure,” said Dean. “My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I’ve got no proof he was a wizard, though.” There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching; then Ted spoke again. (cid:145) 295 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN “I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was you’d been caught.” “I  was,”  said  Dirk.  “I  was  halfway  to  Azkaban  when  I  made  a break for it, Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier than  you’d  think;  I  don’t  reckon  he’s  quite  right  at  the  moment. Might be Confunded. If so, I’d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.” There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed  on.  Then  Ted  said,  “And  where  do  you  two  fit  in?  I,  er, had  the  impression  the  goblins  were  for  You-Know-Who,  on  the whole.” “You had a false impression,” said the higher-voiced of the goblins. “We take no sides. This is a wizards’ war.” “How come you’re in hiding, then?” “I  deemed  it  prudent,”  said  the  deeper-voiced  goblin.  “Having refused what I considered an impertinent request, I could see that my personal safety was in jeopardy.” “What did they ask you to do?” asked Ted. “Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,” replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less human as he said it. “I am not a house-elf.” “What about you, Griphook?” “Similar reasons,” said the higher-voiced goblin. “Gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master.” He  added  something  under  his  breath  in  Gobbledegook,  and Gornuk laughed. “What’s the joke?” asked Dean. “He said,” replied Dirk, “that there are things wizards don’t rec-ognize, either.” (cid:145) 296 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE There was a short pause. “I don’t get it,” said Dean. “I had my small revenge before I left,” said Griphook in English. “Good  man  —  goblin,  I  should  say,”  amended  Ted  hastily. “Didn’t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?” “If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,” re-plied  Griphook.  Gornuk  laughed  again  and  even  Dirk  gave  a  dry chuckle. “Dean and I are still missing something here,” said Ted. “So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,” said Griphook, and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry’s breathing was shallow with excitement: He and Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could. “Didn’t  you  hear  about  that,  Ted?”  asked  Dirk.  “About  the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of Snape’s office at Hogwarts?” An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot. “Never heard a word,” said Ted. “Not in the Prophet, was it?” “Hardly,” chortled Dirk. “Griphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill’s younger sister.” Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines. “She and a couple of friends got into Snape’s office and smashed open  the  glass  case  where  he  was  apparently  keeping  the  sword. Snape  caught  them  as  they  were  trying  to  smuggle  it  down  the staircase.” (cid:145) 297 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN “Ah,  God  bless  ’em,”  said  Ted.  “What  did  they  think,  that they’d be able to use the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself?” “Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn’t safe where it was,” said Dirk. “Couple of days later, once he’d got the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.” The goblins started to laugh again. “I’m still not seeing the joke,” said Ted. “It’s a fake,” rasped Griphook. “The sword of Gryffindor!” “Oh yes. It is a copy — an excellent copy, it is true — but it was Wizard-made. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank.” “I  see,”  said  Ted.  “And  I  take  it  you  didn’t  bother  telling  the Death Eaters this?” “I  saw  no  reason  to  trouble  them  with  the  information,”  said Griphook smugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk’s laughter. Inside  the  tent,  Harry  closed  his  eyes,  willing  someone  to  ask the question he needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged; he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of Ginny’s too. “What happened to Ginny and the others? The ones who tried to steal it?” ferently. “Oh,  they  were  punished,  and  cruelly,”  said  Griphook  indif-(cid:145) 298 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE “They’re okay, though?” asked Ted quickly. “I mean, the Weasleys don’t need any more of their kids injured, do they?” “They  suffered  no  serious  injury,  as  far  as  I  am  aware,”  said Griphook. “Lucky for them,” said Ted. “With Snape’s track record I suppose we should just be glad they’re still alive.” “You  believe  that  story,  then,  do  you,  Ted?”  asked  Dirk.  “You believe Snape killed Dumbledore?” “ ’Course I do,” said Ted. “You’re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it?” “Hard to know what to believe these days,” muttered Dirk. “I know Harry Potter,” said Dean. “And I reckon he’s the real thing — the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.” “Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, son,” said Dirk, “me included. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You’d think, if he knew anything we don’t, or had anything special going for him, he’d be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against him —” “The Prophet?” scoffed Ted. “You deserve to be lied to if you’re still reading that muck, Dirk. You want the facts, try the Quibbler.” There  was  a  sudden  explosion  of  choking  and  retching,  plus  a good deal of thumping; by the sound of it, Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he spluttered, “The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegood’s?” “It’s not so lunatic these days,” said Ted. “You want to give it a look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet’s ignoring, not a  single  mention  of  Crumple-Horned  Snorkacks  in  the  last  issue. How long they’ll let him get away with it, mind, I don’t know. But (cid:145) 299 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN Xeno says, front page of every issue, that any wizard who’s against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-one priority.” “Hard  to  help  a  boy  who’s  vanished  off  the  face  of  the  earth,” said Dirk. “Listen, the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s one hell of an achievement,” said Ted. “I’d take tips from him gladly; it’s what we’re trying to do, stay free, isn’t it?” “Yeah, well, you’ve got a point there,” said Dirk heavily. “With the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him I’d have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who’s to say they haven’t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?” “Ah, don’t say that, Dirk,” murmured Ted. There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away. Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer  they  eavesdropped,  now  found  himself  unable  to  say  more than, “Ginny — the sword —” “I know!” said Hermione. She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit. “Here . . . we . . . are . . .” she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled  at  something  that  was  evidently  in  the  depths  of  the  bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry hurried  to  help  her.  As  they  lifted  the  empty  portrait  of  Phineas (cid:145) 300 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE Nigellus free of Hermione’s bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment. “If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledore’s office,” she panted, as they propped the painting against  the  side  of  the  tent,  “Phineas  Nigellus  would  have  seen  it happen, he hangs right beside the case!” “Unless he was asleep,” said Harry, but he still held his breath as  Hermione  knelt  down  in  front  of  the  empty  canvas,  her  wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said: “Er — Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?” Nothing happened. “Phineas Nigellus?” said Hermione again. “Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? Please?” “ ‘Please’ always helps,” said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Ni-gellus slid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried: “Obscuro!” A  black  blindfold  appeared  over  Phineas  Nigellus’s  clever,  dark eyes, causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain. “What — how dare — what are you — ?” “I’m very sorry, Professor Black,” said Hermione, “but it’s a nec-essary precaution!” “Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ru-ining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?” “Never  mind  where  we  are,”  said  Harry,  and  Phineas  Nigellus froze, abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold. “Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?” “Maybe,” said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Ni-gellus’s interest. “We’ve got a couple of questions to ask you — about the sword of Gryffindor.” (cid:145) 301 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN “Ah,” said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of Harry, “yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there —” “Shut  up  about  my  sister,”  said  Ron  roughly.  Phineas  Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows. “Who else is here?” he asked, turning his head from side to side. “Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster!” “They weren’t thieving,” said Harry. “That sword isn’t Snape’s.” “It  belongs  to  Professor  Snape’s  school,”  said  Phineas  Nigellus. “Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her  punishment,  as  did  the  idiot  Longbottom  and  the  Lovegood oddity!” “Neville  is  not  an  idiot  and  Luna  is  not  an  oddity!”  said Hermione. “Where am I?” repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. “Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?” “Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?” asked Harry urgently. work for the oaf, Hagrid.” “Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some “Hagrid’s not an oaf!” said Hermione shrilly. “And  Snape  might’ve  thought  that  was  a  punishment,”  said Harry, “but Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . they’ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!” He  felt  relieved;  he  had  been  imagining  horrors,  the  Cruciatus Curse at the very least. (cid:145) 302 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE “What  we  really  wanted  to  know,  Professor  Black,  is  whether anyone  else  has,  um,  taken  out  the  sword  at  all?  Maybe  it’s  been taken away for cleaning or — or something?” Phineas  Nigellus  paused  again  in  his  struggles  to  free  his  eyes and sniggered. “Muggle-borns,”  he  said.  “Goblin-made  armor  does  not  require cleaning, simple girl. Goblins’ silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.” “Don’t call Hermione simple,” said Harry. “I grow weary of contradiction,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmaster’s office?” Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration. “Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?” “I beg your pardon?” asked Phineas Nigellus. “Professor  Dumbledore’s  portrait  —  couldn’t  you  bring  him along, here, into yours?” Phineas  Nigellus  turned  his  face  in  the  direction  of  Harry’s voice. “Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside the castle except to visit a painting of them-selves hanging elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me, and after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure you that I shall not be making a return visit!” Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame. “Professor Black,” said Hermione, “couldn’t you just tell us, please, (cid:145) 303 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean?” Phineas snorted impatiently. “I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its  case  was  when  Professor  Dumbledore  used  it  to  break  open  a ring.” Hermione  whipped  around  to  look  at  Harry.  Neither  of  them dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at last man-aged to locate the exit. “Well, good night to you,” he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout. “Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?” Phineas  Nigellus  stuck  his  blindfolded  head  back  into  the picture. “Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!” And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him noth-ing but his murky backdrop. “Harry!” Hermione cried. “I know!” Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did not even feel  hungry  anymore.  Hermione  was  squashing  Phineas  Nigellus’s portrait back into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry. “The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only  that  which  strengthen  them  —  Harry,  that  sword’s  impreg-nated with basilisk venom!” (cid:145) 304 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE “And Dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket —” “— and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if he put it in his will —” “— so he made a copy —” “— and put a fake in the glass case —” “— and he left the real one — where?” They gazed at each other; Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn’t Dum-bledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not realized it at the time? “Think!”  whispered  Hermione.  “Think!  Where  would  he  have left it?” “Not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, resuming his pacing. “Somewhere in Hogsmeade?” suggested Hermione. “The  Shrieking  Shack?”  said  Harry.  “Nobody  ever  goes  in there.” Hermione. “But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?” “Dumbledore trusted Snape,” Harry reminded her. “Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,” said “Yeah, you’re right!” said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the thought that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however faint,  about  Snape’s  trustworthiness.  “So,  would  he  have  hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade,  then?  What  d’you  reckon, Ron? Ron?” Harry  looked  around.  For  one  bewildered  moment  he  thought that Ron had left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk, looking stony. (cid:145) 305 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN “Oh, remembered me, have you?” he said. “What?” Ron  snorted  as  he  stared  up  at  the  underside  of  the  upper bunk. “You two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.” Perplexed,  Harry  looked  to  Hermione  for  help,  but  she  shook her head, apparently as nonplussed as he was. “What’s the problem?” asked Harry. “Problem? There’s no problem,” said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. “Not according to you, anyway.” There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain. “Well, you’ve obviously got a problem,” said Harry. “Spit it out, will you?” unlike himself. Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, “All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you don’t know.” “I don’t know?” repeated Harry, “I don’t know?” Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it  pattered  on  the  leaf-strewn  bank  all  around  them  and  into  the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry’s jubilation: Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking. “It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here,” said Ron, “you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved something.” (cid:145) 306 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE “Ron,” Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now beating on the tent. “I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,” said Harry. “Yeah, I thought I did too.” “So  what  part  of  it  isn’t  living  up  to  your  expectations?”  asked Harry. Anger was coming to his defense now. “Did you think we’d be  staying  in  five-star  hotels?  Finding  a  Horcrux  every  other  day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?” “We  thought  you  knew  what  you  were  doing!”  shouted  Ron, standing up, and his words pierced Harry like scalding knives. “We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!” “Ron!”  said  Hermione,  this  time  clearly  audible  over  the  rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her. “Well, sorry to let you down,” said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, inadequate. “I’ve been straight with you from the start, I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found one Horcrux —” “Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!” “Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice unusually high.  “Please  take  it  off.  You  wouldn’t  be  talking  like  this  if  you hadn’t been wearing it all day.” “Yeah, he would,” said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. “D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D’you think I didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff?” “Harry, we weren’t —” (cid:145) 307 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN “Don’t lie!” Ron hurled at her. “You said it too, you said you were disappointed, you said you’d thought he had a bit more to go on than —” “I didn’t say it like that — Harry, I didn’t!” she cried. The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermi-one’s face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as  if  it  had  never  been,  a  short-lived  firework  that  had  flared  and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryffin-dor was hidden they knew not where, and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be dead. “So why are you still here?” Harry asked Ron. “Search me,” said Ron. “Go home then,” said Harry. “Yeah,  maybe  I  will!”  shouted  Ron,  and  he  took  several  steps toward Harry, who did not back away. “Didn’t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you, it’s only the  Forbidden  Forest,  Harry  I’ve-Faced-Worse  Potter  doesn’t  care what happens to her in here — well,  I  do,  all  right,  giant  spiders and mental stuff —” “I  was  only  saying  —  she  was  with  the  others,  they  were  with Hagrid —” “Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the rest of my family, ‘the Weasleys don’t need another kid injured,’ did you hear that?” “Yeah, I —” “Not bothered what it meant, though?” “Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. “I don’t think  it  means  anything  new  has  happened,  anything  we  don’t know  about;  think,  Ron,  Bill’s  already  scarred,  plenty  of  people (cid:145) 308 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  GOBLIN’S  REVENGE must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you’re sup-posed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I’m sure that’s all he meant —” “Oh, you’re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won’t bother my-self about them. It’s all right for you two, isn’t it, with your parents safely out of the way —” “My parents are dead!” Harry bellowed. “And mine could be going the same way!” yelled Ron. “Then  GO!”  roared  Harry.  “Go  back  to  them,  pretend  you’ve got over your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and —” Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before ei-ther wand was clear of its owner’s pocket, Hermione had raised her own. “Protego!”  she  cried,  and  an  invisible  shield  expanded  between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron: Something had broken between them. “Leave the Horcrux,” Harry said. Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to Hermione. “What are you doing?” “What do you mean?” “Are you staying, or what?” “I . . .” She looked anguished. “Yes — yes, I’m staying. Ron, we said we’d go with Harry, we said we’d help —” (cid:145) 309 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  FIFTEEN “I get it. You choose him.” “Ron, no — please — come back, come back!” She  was  impeded  by  her  own  Shield  Charm;  by  the  time  she had removed it he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron’s name amongst the trees. After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face. “He’s g-g-gone! Disapparated!” She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry. Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron’s bunk and threw  them  over  Hermione.  Then  he  climbed  onto  his  own  bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain. (cid:145) 310 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  S I X T E E N GODRIC’S HOLLOW    W hen  Harry  woke  the  following  day  it  was  several  sec-onds  before  he  remembered  what  had  happened.  Then he hoped, childishly, that it had been a dream, that Ron was still there and had never left. Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron’s deserted bunk. It was like a dead body in the way it seemed to draw his eyes. Harry jumped down from his own bed, keeping  his  eyes  averted  from  Ron’s.  Hermione,  who  was  already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but turned her face away quickly as he went by. He’s gone, Harry told himself. He’s gone. He had to keep think-ing it as he washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull the shock of it. He’s gone and he’s not coming back. And that was the simple  truth  of  it,  Harry  knew,  because  their  protective  enchant-ments  meant  that  it  would  be  impossible,  once  they  vacated  this spot, for Ron to find them again. He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione’s eyes were (cid:145) 311 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIXTEEN puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and saw  nothing  but  rain-swept  woods,  another  little  parcel  of  fury exploded  inside  him.  He  could  hear  Ron  saying,  “We  thought  you knew what you were doing!”, and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach. The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank. They had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite. Finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay: She and Harry grasped hands and  Disapparated,  reappearing  on  a  windswept  heather-covered hillside. The  instant  they  arrived,  Hermione  dropped  Harry’s  hand  and walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept  him  rooted  to  the  spot.  Everything  inside  him  felt  cold  and tight:  Again  he  saw  the  contemptuous  expression  on  Ron’s  face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection. They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed (cid:145) 312 (cid:145) \\x0cGODRIC’S  HOLLOW to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder’s Map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron’s  labeled  dot  would  reappear  in  the  corridors  of  Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by  his  status  of  pureblood.  However,  Ron  did  not  appear  on  the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare  at  Ginny’s  name  in  the  girls’  dormitory,  wondering  whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right. By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the pos-sible locations of Gryffindor’s sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more des-perate and far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though  he  might,  Harry  could  not  remember  Dumbledore  ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something. There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew what you were doing. . . . We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do. . . . We thought you had a real plan! He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumble-dore had left him with virtually nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it: The others were as  unattainable  as  they  had  ever  been.  Hopelessness  threatened  to engulf him. He was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends’ offers to accompany him on this meander-ing, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he (cid:145) 313 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIXTEEN was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indication that Her-mione too was about to tell him that she had had enough, that she was leaving. They were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermi-one took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus’s portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by  Ron’s  departure.  Despite  his  previous  assertion  that  he  would never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to re-sist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to, and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind. They relished any news about what was happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting. However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, low level of mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny  had  been  banned  from  going  into  Hogsmeade.  Snape  had reinstated Umbridge’s old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies. From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and prob-ably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumbledore’s Army. This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him  think  of  Ron  again,  and  of  Dumbledore,  and  of  Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend. Indeed, as  Phineas  Nigellus  talked  about  Snape’s  crackdown,  Harry  expe-(cid:145) 314 (cid:145) \\x0cGODRIC’S  HOLLOW rienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of Snape’s regime: Be-ing  fed,  and  having  a  soft  bed,  and  other  people  being  in  charge, seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment. But  then  he  remembered  that  he  was  Undesirable  Number  One, that there was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized  this  fact  by  slipping in leading questions about Harry and  Hermione’s  whereabouts.  Hermione  shoved  him  back  inside the beaded bag every time he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invari-ably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious good-byes. The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any one area too long, so rather than staying in the south of Eng-land, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they continued to meander up and down the country, braving a moun-tainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow half buried the tent in the night. They had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several sitting  room  windows  before  there  came  an  evening  when  Harry resolved to suggest, again, what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left), and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours’ break from (cid:145) 315 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIXTEEN wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him. “Hermione?” “Hmm?” She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The Tales of Beedle the Bard. He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, which was not, after all, very long; but  evidently  she  was  still  deciphering  something  in  it,  because Spellman’s Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair. Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several years previously, when he had asked Professor Mc-Gonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip. “Hermione, I’ve been thinking, and —” “Harry, could you help me with something?” Apparently  she  had  not  been  listening  to  him.  She  leaned forward and held out The Tales of Beedle the Bard. “Look at that symbol,” she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story (being unable to  read  runes,  he  could  not  be  sure),  there  was  a  picture  of  what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line. “I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.” “I know that, but it isn’t a rune and it’s not in the syllabary, either. All along I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don’t think it is! It’s been inked in, look, somebody’s drawn it there, it isn’t really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?” “No . . . No, wait a moment.” Harry looked closer. “Isn’t it the same symbol Luna’s dad was wearing round his neck?” “Well, that’s what I thought too!” “Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark.” (cid:145) 316 (cid:145) \\x0cGODRIC’S  HOLLOW She stared at him, openmouthed. “What?” “Krum told me . . .” He  recounted  the  story  that  Viktor  Krum  had  told  him  at  the wedding. Hermione looked astonished. “Grindelwald’s mark?” She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. “I’ve never heard that Grindelwald had a mark. There’s no mention of it in anything I’ve ever read about him.” “Well,  like  I  say,  Krum  reckoned  that  symbol  was  carved  on  a wall at Durmstrang, and Grindelwald put it there.” She fell back into the old armchair, frowning. “That’s very odd. If it’s a symbol of Dark Magic, what’s it doing in a book of children’s stories?” “Yeah,  it  is  weird,”  said  Harry.  “And  you’d  think  Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.” “I know. . . . Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories have little pictures over the titles.” She did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. Harry tried again. “Hermione?” “Hmm?” “I’ve been thinking. I — I want to go to Godric’s Hollow.” She  looked  up  at  him,  but  her  eyes  were  unfocused,  and  he was  sure  she  was  still  thinking  about  the  mysterious  mark  on  the book. “Yes,” she said. “Yes, I’ve been wondering that too. I really think we’ll have to.” (cid:145) 317 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIXTEEN “Did you hear me right?” he asked. “Of course I did. You want to go to Godric’s Hollow. I agree, I think we should. I mean, I can’t think of anywhere else it could be either. It’ll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more likely it seems it’s there.” “Er — what’s there?” asked Harry. At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt. “Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you’d want  to  go  back  there,  and  I  mean,  Godric’s  Hollow  is  Godric Gryffindor’s birthplace —” “Really? Gryffindor came from Godric’s Hollow?” “Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?” “Erm,” he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months: The muscles in his face felt oddly stiff. “I might’ve opened it, you know, when I bought it . . . just the once. . . .” “Well,  as  the  village  is  named  after  him  I’d  have  thought  you might  have  made  the  connection,”  said  Hermione.  She  sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late; Harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library. “There’s a bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait . . .” She  opened  the  beaded  bag  and  rummaged  for  a  while,  finally extracting her copy of their old school textbook, A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through until finding the page she wanted. “ ‘Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small communities within a community. Many small  villages  and  hamlets  attracted  several  magical  families,  who  banded  together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworth (cid:145) 318 (cid:145) \\x0cGODRIC’S  HOLLOW in Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Mug-gles.  Most  celebrated  of  these  half-magical  dwelling  places  is,  perhaps, Godric’s  Hollow,  the  West  Country  village  where  the  great  wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizard-ing smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.’ “You and your parents aren’t mentioned,” Hermione said, closing the  book,  “because  Professor  Bagshot  doesn’t  cover  anything  later than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hol-low, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think Dum-bledore would have expected you to make the connection?” “Oh yeah . . .” Harry  did  not  want  to  admit  that  he  had  not  been  thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hol-low. For him, the lure of the village lay in his parents’ graves, the house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot. “Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually. “Who?” “You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron’s name. “Ginny’s  great-aunt.  At  the  wedding.  The  one  who  said  you  had skinny ankles.” “Oh,” said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had sensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on: “She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.” (cid:145) 319 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIXTEEN “Bathilda  Bagshot,”  murmured  Hermione,  running  her  index finger over Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of A His-tory of Magic. “Well, I suppose —” She gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over; he drew his wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there. “What?”  he  said,  half  angry,  half  relieved.  “What  did  you  do that for? I thought you’d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least —” “Harry,  what  if  Bathilda’s  got  the  sword?  What  if  Dumbledore entrusted it to her?” Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now, and according to Muriel, she was “gaga.” Was it likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance:  Dumbledore  had  never  revealed  that  he  had  replaced  the sword with a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt on Hermione’s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with Harry’s dearest wish. “Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric’s Hollow?” “Yes,  but  we’ll  have  to  think  it  through  carefully,  Harry.”  She was sitting up now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of hav-ing a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. “We’ll need to practice  Disapparating  together  under  the  Invisibility  Cloak  for  a start, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless  you  think  we  should  go  the  whole  hog  and  use  Polyjuice (cid:145) 320 (cid:145) \\x0cGODRIC’S  HOLLOW Potion?  In  that  case  we’ll  need  to  collect  hair  from  somebody.  I actually think we’d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the better. . . .” Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause, but his mind had left the conversation. For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he felt excited. He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family. It was in Godric’s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday. He could have invited friends to his house. . . . He might even have had broth-ers and sisters. . . . It would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione’s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago. For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up at him from the images, which were all he had left of them now. Harry would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow the follow-ing day, but Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his parents’ deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later — once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent  Muggles  who  were  Christmas  shopping,  and  had  prac-ticed Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together — that Hermione agreed to make the journey. (cid:145) 321 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIXTEEN They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Po-tion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione  into  his  small  and  rather  mousy  wife.  The  beaded  bag containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry  was  wearing  around  his  neck)  was  tucked  into  an  inside pocket of Hermione’s buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the  Invis-ibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the suffocating dark-ness once again. Heart  beating  in  his  throat,  Harry  opened  his  eyes.  They  were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky, in which  the  night’s  first  stars  were  already  glimmering  feebly.  Cot-tages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the village. “All this snow!” Hermione whispered  beneath  the  cloak.  “Why didn’t we think of snow? After all our precautions, we’ll leave prints! We’ll just have to get rid of them — you go in front, I’ll do it —” Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces. “Let’s  take  off  the  Cloak,”  said  Harry,  and  when  she  looked frightened, “Oh, come on, we don’t look like us and there’s no one around.” He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages: Any one of them might have been the one in which James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front (cid:145) 322 (cid:145) \\x0cGODRIC’S  HOLLOW porches, wondering whether he remembered any of them, knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever. He was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all; he did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, was revealed to them. Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a  war  memorial  in  the  middle,  partly  obscured  by  a  windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel-bright across the square. The snow here had become impacted: It was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in  front  of  them,  their  figures  briefly  illuminated  by  streetlamps. They  heard  a  snatch  of  laughter  and  pop  music  as  the  pub  door opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little church. “Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said Hermione. “Is it?” He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks. “I’m sure it is,” said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. “They . . . they’ll be in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.” Harry  felt  a  thrill  of  something  that  was  beyond  excitement, more like fear. Now that he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feel-ing, because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first (cid:145) 323 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIXTEEN time, pulling him forward. Halfway across the square, however, she stopped dead. “Harry, look!” She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it  had  transformed.  Instead  of  an  obelisk  covered  in  names,  there was a statue of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sit-ting in his mother’s arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps. Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents’ faces. He had never imagined that there would be a statue. . . . How strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on his forehead. . . . “C’mon,” said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again toward the church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war memorial. The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harry’s throat constrict, it reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of ar-mor,  of  the  Great  Hall’s  twelve  Christmas  trees,  of  Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater. . . . There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermi-one pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it. On either side of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carv-ing deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows. Behind  the  church,  row  upon  row  of  snowy  tombstones  pro-(cid:145) 324 (cid:145) \\x0cGODRIC’S  HOLLOW truded from a blanket of  pale  blue  that  was  flecked  with  dazzling red, gold, and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit  the  snow.  Keeping  his  hand  closed  tightly  on  the  wand  in  his jacket pocket, Harry moved toward the nearest grave. “Look at this, it’s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of Hannah’s!” “Keep your voice down,” Hermione begged him. They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied. “Harry, here!” Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his heart positively banging in his chest. “Is it — ?” “No, but look!” She  pointed  to  the  dark  stone.  Harry  stooped  down  and  saw, upon the frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words  Kendra  Dum-bledore and, a short way below her dates of birth and death, and Her Daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation: Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  So  Rita  Skeeter  and  Muriel  had  got  some  of  their  facts  right. The Dumbledore family had indeed lived here, and part of it had died here. Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet he (cid:145) 325 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIXTEEN had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to him. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact  that  their  families  lay  side  by  side  in  the  same  graveyard  had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do. Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. He did not understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died. “Are you sure he never mentioned — ?” Hermione began. “No,” said Harry curtly, then, “let’s keep looking,” and he turned away, wishing he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment. “Here!” cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness. “Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.” She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on her face. “Harry, come back a moment.” He  did  not  want  to  be  sidetracked  again,  and  only  grudgingly made his way back through the snow toward her. “What?” “Look at this!” The  grave  was  extremely  old,  weathered  so  that  Harry  could hardly make out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol be-neath it. “Harry, that’s the mark in the book!” (cid:145) 326 (cid:145) \\x0cGODRIC’S  HOLLOW He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name. “Yeah . . . it could be. . . .” Hermione  lit  her  wand  and  pointed  it  at  the  name  on  the headstone. “It says Ig — Ignotus, I think. . . .” “I’m  going  to  keep  looking  for  my  parents,  all  right?”  Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave. Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had met at Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family represented in the graveyard: Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or the cur-rent members had moved away from Godric’s Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation. The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much  deeper.  Harry  looked  around,  worried,  thinking  of  demen-tors,  then  realized  that  the  carols  had  finished,  that  the  chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square. Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights. Then Hermione’s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and clear from a few yards away. “Harry, they’re here . . . right here.” And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time:  He  moved  toward  her,  feeling  as  if  something  heavy  were pressing  on  his  chest,  the  same  sensation  he  had  had  right  after (cid:145) 327 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SIXTEEN Dumbledore  had  died,  a  grief  that  had  actually  weighed  on  his heart and lungs. The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana’s. It was made of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and this made it easy to read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it.  g^jbp=mlqqbo=_lok=OT=j^o`e=NVSM=ifiv=mlqqbo=_lok=PM=g^kr^ov=NVSM=afba=PN=l`ql_bo=NVUN=afba=PN=l`ql_bo=NVUN=The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.  Harry  read  the  words  slowly,  as  though  he  would  have  only one chance to take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud. “ ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’. . .” A horrible thought came to him, and with it a kind of panic. “Isn’t that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there?” “It  doesn’t  mean  defeating  death  in  the  way  the  Death  Eaters mean it, Harry,” said Hermione, her voice gentle. “It means . . . you know . . . living beyond death. Living after death.” But they were not living, thought Harry: They were gone. The empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents’ moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And tears  came  before  he  could  stop  them,  boiling  hot  then  instantly freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking (cid:145) 328 (cid:145) \\x0cGODRIC’S  HOLLOW down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under the snow with them. Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He  could  not  look  at  her,  but  returned  the  pressure,  now  taking deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying to regain control. He should have brought something to give them, and he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents’ grave. As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave: He did not think he could stand another moment there. He put his arm around Hermi-one’s shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through  the  snow,  past  Dumbledore’s mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.

Someone watching us. I can tell. There, They stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense black boundary of the graveyard. Harry could not see anything. “Are you sure?” “I saw something move, I could have sworn I did. . . .” She broke from him to free her wand arm. “We look like Muggles,” Harry pointed out. “Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave! Harry, I’m sure there’s someone over there!” Harry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be haunted: what if — ? But then he heard a rustle and saw a   (cid:145) 330 (cid:145) \\x0cBATHILDA’S  SECRET little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow. “It’s a cat,” said Harry, after a second or two, “or a bird. If it was a Death Eater we’d be dead by now. But let’s get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on.” They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slip-pery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over them-selves. The pub was fuller than before: Many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the church. For a moment Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside  it,  but  before  he  could  say  anything  Hermione  murmured, “Let’s go this way,” and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They walked as quickly as they dared,  past  more  windows  sparkling  with  multicolored  lights,  the outlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains. “How are we going to find Bathilda’s house?” asked Hermione, who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder. “Harry? What do you think? Harry?” She tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione along with him; she slipped a little on the ice. “Harry —” “Look. . . . Look at it, Hermione. . . .”  (cid:145) 331 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVENTEEN “I don’t . . . oh!” He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had  taken  Harry  from  the  rubble  that  lay  scattered  amongst  the waist-high  grass.  Most  of  the  cottage  was  still  standing,  though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor  had  been  blown  apart;  that,  Harry  was  sure,  was  where  the curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it. “I wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it?” whispered Hermione. “Maybe you can’t rebuild it?” Harry replied. “Maybe it’s like the injuries from Dark Magic and you can’t repair the damage?” He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, not wishing to open it, but simply to hold some part of the house. “You’re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might — oh, Harry, look!” His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the ground in front of them, up through the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in golden let-ters upon the wood it said:  On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981, Lily and James Potter lost their lives. Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse. This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters (cid:145) 332 (cid:145) \\x0cBATHILDA’S  SECRET and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family. And  all  around  these  neatly  lettered  words,  scribbles  had  been added by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place where  the  Boy  Who  Lived  had  escaped.  Some  had  merely  signed their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into the wood, still others had left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen years’ worth of magical graffiti, all said similar things. Good luck, Harry, wherever you are. If you read this, Harry, we’re all behind you! Long live Harry Potter.  “They  shouldn’t  have  written  on  the  sign!”  said  Hermione, indignant. But Harry beamed at her. “It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I . . .” He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the figure was a woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the  snowy  ground.  Her  stoop,  her  stoutness,  her  shuffling  gait  all gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew instinctively that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them. (cid:145) 333 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVENTEEN He did not need Hermione’s pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that this woman was a Muggle: She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however, it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at  an  old  ruin.  By  all  the  rules  of  normal  magic,  meanwhile,  she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they were. Just as he had reached this uneasy conclu-sion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned. Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against his. “How does she know?” He  shook  his  head.  The  woman  beckoned  again,  more  vigor-ously.  Harry  could  think  of  many  reasons  not  to  obey  the  sum-mons,  and  yet  his  suspicions  about  her  identity  were  growing stronger  every  moment  that  they  stood  facing  each  other  in  the deserted street. Was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months?  That  Dumbledore  had  told  her  to  wait,  and  that  Harry would come in the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power that he had never encountered before. Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump. “Are you Bathilda?” The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again. Beneath  the  Cloak  Harry  and  Hermione  looked  at  each  other. Harry raised his eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod. (cid:145) 334 (cid:145) \\x0cBATHILDA’S  SECRET They  stepped  toward  the  woman  and,  at  once,  she  turned  and hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let them pass. She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house: Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry’s face. Her eyes were thick with cata-racts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see. The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified  as  she  unwound  a  moth-eaten  black  shawl,  revealing  a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly. “Bathilda?” Harry repeated. She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near? Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room. “Harry, I’m not sure about this,” breathed Hermione. “Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had (cid:145) 335 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVENTEEN to,” said Harry. “Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn’t all there. Muriel called her ‘gaga.’ ” “Come!” called Bathilda from the next room. Hermione jumped and clutched Harry’s arm. “It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room. Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it  was  still  very  dark,  not  to  mention  extremely  dirty.  Thick  dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry’s nose detected, underneath the  dank  and  mildewed  smell,  something  worse,  like  meat  gone bad. He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda’s house to check whether she was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for she lit the candles clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catch-ing fire. “Let me do that,” offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups. The  last  surface  on  which  Harry  spotted  a  candle  was  a  bow-fronted  chest  of  drawers  on  which  there  stood  a  large  number  of photographs. When the flame danced into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered “Tergeo”: The dust vanished from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most or-nate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up. (cid:145) 336 (cid:145) \\x0cBATHILDA’S  SECRET It was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had perched on Gregorovitch’s windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where he had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs were: in Rita’s book. “Mrs. — Miss — Bagshot?” he said, and his voice shook slightly. “Who is this?” Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Her-mione light the fire for her. “Miss Bagshot?” Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux beat faster upon his chest. “Who  is  this  person?”  Harry  asked  her,  pushing  the  picture forward. She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry. “Do you know who this is?” he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual. “This man? Do you know him? What’s he called?” Bathilda  merely  looked  vague.  Harry  felt  an  awful  frustration. How had Rita Skeeter unlocked Bathilda’s memories? “Who is this man?” he repeated loudly. “Harry, what are you doing?” asked Hermione. “This picture, Hermione, it’s the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!” he said to Bathilda. “Who is this?” But she only stared at him. “Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. — Miss — Bag-shot?”  asked  Hermione,  raising  her  own  voice.  “Was  there  some-thing you wanted to tell us?” (cid:145) 337 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVENTEEN Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuf-fled a few steps closer to Harry. With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall. “You want us to leave?” he asked. She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at herself, then at the ceiling. “Oh, right . . . Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her.” “All right,” said Hermione, “let’s go.” But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with sur-prising vigor, once more pointing first at Harry, then to herself. “She wants me to go with her, alone.” “Why?” asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in  the  candlelit  room;  the  old  lady  shook  her  head  a  little  at  the loud noise. “Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?” “Do you really think she knows who you are?” “Yes,” said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own, “I think she does.” “Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry.” “Lead the way,” Harry told Bathilda. She seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him to-ward the door. Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; she stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase. As Harry walked out of the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he slipped the silver-framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket. (cid:145) 338 (cid:145) \\x0cBATHILDA’S  SECRET The stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half tempted to place his  hands  on  stout  Bathilda’s  backside  to  ensure  that  she  did  not topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, turned immediately right, and led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom. It was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness. “Lumos,”  said  Harry,  and  his  wand  ignited.  He  gave  a  start: Bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her approach. “You are Potter?” she whispered. “Yes, I am.” She  nodded  slowly,  solemnly.  Harry  felt  the  Horcrux  beating fast,  faster  than  his  own  heart:  It  was  an  unpleasant,  agitating sensation. “Have you got anything for me?” Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-tip. “Have you got anything for me?” he repeated. Then  she  closed  her  eyes  and  several  things  happened  at  once: Harry’s  scar  prickled  painfully;  the  Horcrux  twitched  so  that  the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: Hold him! Harry  swayed  where  he  stood:  The  dark,  foul-smelling  room seemed to close around him again; he did not know what had just happened. “Have you got anything for me?” he asked for a third time, much louder. (cid:145) 339 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVENTEEN “Over here,” she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window. This  time  she  did  not  lead  him. Harry edged between her and the  unmade  bed,  his  wand  raised.  He  did  not  want  to  look  away from her. “What is it?” he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry. “There,” she said, pointing at the shapeless mass. And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tan-gled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been. The snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung  dizzyingly  around  the  room  and  was  extinguished:  Then  a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing — He  rolled  sideways,  narrowly  avoiding  the  snake’s  tail,  which thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier: Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor. From below he heard Hermione call, “Harry?” He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a heavy smooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular — “No!” he gasped, pinned to the floor. “Yes,” whispered the voice. “Yesss . . . hold you . . . hold you . . .” (cid:145) 340 (cid:145) \\x0cBATHILDA’S  SECRET “Accio . . . Accio Wand . . .” But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his brain  was  flooding  with  cold,  white  light,  all  thought  obliterated, his own breath drowned, distant footsteps, everything going. . . . A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was fly-ing, flying with triumph in his heart, without need of broomstick or thestral. . . . He was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered. Fro-zen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something — his wand — He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking Harry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years. “He’s coming! Hermione, he’s coming!” As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew every-where as Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione — (cid:145) 341 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVENTEEN She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake reared again, but Harry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to split open with the pain from his scar — The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, Hermione screamed, “Confringo!” and her spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricochet-ing back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermi-one with him, he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight  out  of  the  smashed  window  into  nothingness,  her  scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair. . . . And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid bedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled with the girl’s, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in Christmas Day. . . . And his scream was Harry’s scream, his pain was Harry’s pain . . . that it could happen here, where it had happened before . . . here, within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing what it was to die . . . to die. . . .

The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins wad-dling across the square, and the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all  the  tawdry  Muggle  trappings  of  a  world  in  which  they  did  not believe. . . . And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power (cid:145) 342 (cid:145) \\x0cBATHILDA’S  SECRET and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions. . . . Not anger . . . that was for weaker souls than he . . . but triumph, yes. . . . He had waited for this, he had hoped for it. . . . “Nice costume, mister!” He saw the small boy’s smile falter as he ran near enough to see be-neath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his painted face: Then the child turned and ran away. . . . Beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand. . . . One simple movement and the child would never reach his mother . . . but unnecessary, quite unnecessary. . . . And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destina-tion was in sight at last, the Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet. . . . And he made less noise than the dead leaves slith-ering  along  the  pavement  as  he  drew  level  with  the  dark  hedge,  and stared over it. . . . They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child was laughing and try-ing to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist. . . . A  door  opened  and  the  mother  entered,  saying  words  he  could  not hear, her long dark-red hair falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother. He threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning. . . . The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear. His white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open. He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he had not even picked up his wand. . . . “Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off!” (cid:145) 343 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVENTEEN Hold him off, without a wand in his hand! . . . He laughed before casting the curse. . . . “Avada Kedavra!” The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against  the  wall,  it  made  the  banisters  glare  like  lightning  rods,  and James Potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut. . . . He could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear. . . . He climbed  the  steps,  listening  with  faint  amusement  to  her  attempts  to barricade herself in. . . . She had no wand upon her either. . . . How stupid  they  were,  and  how  trusting,  thinking  that  their  safety  lay  in friends, that weapons could be discarded even for moments. . . . He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand . . . and there she stood, the child in her arms. At the sight of him, she dropped her son into the crib behind  her  and  threw  her  arms  wide,  as  if  this  would  help,  as  if  in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead. . . . “Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!” “Stand aside, you silly girl . . . stand aside, now.” “Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead —” “This is my last warning —” “Not Harry! Please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy. . . . Not Harry!  Not Harry! Please — I’ll do anything —” “Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!” He  could  have  forced  her  away  from  the  crib,  but  it  seemed  more prudent to finish them all. . . . The  green  light  flashed  around  the  room  and  she  dropped  like  her husband. The child had not cried all this time: He could stand, clutch-ing the bars of his crib, and he looked up into the intruder’s face with a (cid:145) 344 (cid:145) \\x0cBATHILDA’S  SECRET kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop up any moment, laughing — He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy’s face: He wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The child began to cry: It had seen that he was not James. He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in the orphanage — “Avada Kedavra!” And then he broke: He was nothing, nothing but pain and ter-ror,  and  he  must  hide  himself,  not  here  in  the  rubble  of  the  ruined house, where the child was trapped and screaming, but far away . . . far away. . . . “No,” he moaned. The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy. . . . “No . . .” And  now  he  stood  at  the  broken  window  of  Bathilda’s  house,  im-mersed in memories of his greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered  over  broken  china  and  glass.  .  .  .  He  looked  down  and  saw something . . . something incredible. . . . “No . . .” “Harry, it’s all right, you’re all right!” He stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he was, the unknown thief, the thief he was seeking. . . . “No . . . I dropped it. . . . I dropped it. . . .” “Harry, it’s okay, wake up, wake up!” He was Harry. . . . Harry, not Voldemort . . . and the thing that was rustling was not a snake. . . . He opened his eyes. (cid:145) 345 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVENTEEN “Harry,” Hermione whispered. “Do you feel all — all right?” “Yes,” he lied. He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets. He could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and the quality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. He was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets. “We got away.” “Yes,” said Hermione. “I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk, I couldn’t lift you. You’ve been . . . Well, you haven’t been quite . . .” There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand: She had been wiping his face. “You’ve been ill,” she finished. “Quite ill.” “How long ago did we leave?” “Hours ago. It’s nearly morning.” “And I’ve been . . . what, unconscious?” “Not exactly,” said Hermione uncomfortably. “You’ve been shout-ing and moaning and . . . things,” she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy. What had he done? Screamed curses like Volde-mort, cried like the baby in the crib? “I couldn’t get the Horcrux off you,” Hermione said, and he knew she wanted to change the subject. “It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You’ve got a mark; I’m sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away. The snake bit you too, but I’ve cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it. . . .” He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down. There was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. He could also see the half-healed puncture marks to his forearm. (cid:145) 346 (cid:145) \\x0cBATHILDA’S  SECRET “Where’ve you put the Horcrux?” “In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while.” He  lay  back  on  his  pillows  and  looked  into  her  pinched  gray face. “We shouldn’t have gone to Godric’s Hollow. It’s my fault, it’s all my fault, Hermione, I’m sorry.” “It’s not your fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumble-dore might have left the sword there for you.” “Yeah, well . . . we got that wrong, didn’t we?” “What  happened,  Harry?  What  happened  when  she  took  you upstairs?  Was  the  snake  hiding  somewhere?  Did  it  just  come  out and kill her and attack you?” “No,” he said. “She was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . all along.” “W-what?” He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made the whole thing horribly vivid. “Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was in-side her. You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I’d go back.” “The snake was inside her?” He  opened  his  eyes  again:  Hermione looked  revolted, nauseated. “Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,” Harry said.  “She  didn’t  want  to  talk  in  front  of  you,  because  it  was Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I could understand her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . . and then . . .” (cid:145) 347 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  SEVENTEEN He remembered the snake coming our of Bathilda’s neck: Hermi-one did not need to know the details. “. . . she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked.” He looked down at the puncture marks. “It wasn’t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who came.” If  he  had  only  managed  to  kill  the  snake,  it  would  have  been worth it, all of it. . . . Sick at heart, he sat up and threw back the covers. “Harry, no, I’m sure you ought to rest!” “You’re the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible. I’m fine. I’ll keep watch for a while. Where’s my wand?” She did not answer, she merely looked at him. “Where’s my wand, Hermione?” She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes. “Harry . . .” “Where’s my wand?” She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him. The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One frag-ile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together. The wood had splintered apart completely. Harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury. He  could  not  think  properly:  Everything  was  a  blur  of  panic  and fear. Then he held out the wand to Hermione. “Mend it. Please.” “Harry, I don’t think, when it’s broken like this —” “Please, Hermione, try!” “R-Reparo.” The dangling half of the wand resealed itself. Harry held it up. (cid:145) 348 (cid:145) \\x0cBATHILDA’S  SECRET “Lumos!” The  wand  sparked  feebly,  then  went  out.  Harry  pointed  it  at Hermione. “Expelliarmus!” Hermione’s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The feeble attempt at magic was too much for Harry’s wand, which split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what he was seeing . . . the wand that had survived so much . . . “Harry,” Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. “I’m so, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have — must have hit —” “It  was  an  accident,”  said  Harry  mechanically.  He  felt  empty, stunned. “We’ll — we’ll find a way to repair it.” “Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said Hermione, the tears trickling down her face. “Remember . . . remember Ron? When he broke his wand, crashing the car? It was never the same again, he had to get a new one.” Harry  thought  of  Ollivander,  kidnapped  and  held  hostage  by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who was dead. How was he supposed to find himself a new wand? “Well,”  he  said,  in  a  falsely  matter-of-fact  voice,  “well,  I’ll  just borrow yours for now, then. While I keep watch.” Her  face  glazed  with  tears,  Hermione  handed  over  her  wand, and he left her sitting beside his bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her. (cid:145) 349 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  E I G H T E E N THE LIFE AND LIES OF  ALBUS DUMBLEDORE  T he sun was coming up: The pure, colorless vastness of the sky stretched over him, indifferent to him and his suffering. Harry sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep breath of clean air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside  ought  to  have  been  the  greatest  treasure  on  earth,  yet  he could not appreciate it: His senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his wand. He looked out over a valley blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence. Without realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying to resist physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more  times  than  he  could  count;  he  had  lost  all  the  bones  in  his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of his magical power had been torn  from  him.  He  knew  exactly  what  Hermione  would  say  if  he (cid:145) 350 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LIFE  AND  LIES  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard. But she was wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the protection of the twin cores, and only now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting upon it. He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without  looking  at  them,  tucked  them  away  in  Hagrid’s  pouch around his neck. The pouch was now too full of broken and use-less objects to take any more. Harry’s hand brushed the old Snitch through the mokeskin and for a moment he had to fight the temp-tation  to  pull  it  out  and  throw  it  away.  Impenetrable,  unhelpful, useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind — And  his  fury  at  Dumbledore  broke  over  him  now  like  lava, scorching him inside, wiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that Godric’s Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were supposed to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore; but there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had left  them  to  grope  in  the  darkness,  to  wrestle  with  unknown  and undreamed-of  terrors,  alone  and  unaided:  Nothing  was  explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and now, Harry had no wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely be easy now for Voldemort to find out who he was. . . . Voldemort had all the information now. . . . “Harry?” Hermione  looked  frightened  that  he  might  curse  her  with  her own wand. Her face streaked with tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky under her arm. (cid:145) 351 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHTEEN “Thanks,” he said, taking one of the cups. “Do you mind if I talk to you?” “No,” he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings. “Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well . . . I’ve got the book.” Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and  Lies of Albus Dumbledore. “Where — how — ?” “It was in Bathilda’s sitting room, just lying there. . . . This note was sticking out of the top of it.” Hermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud. “ ‘Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here’s a copy of the book, hope you like it. You said everything, even if you don’t remember it. Rita.’ I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps she wasn’t in any fit state to read it?” “No, she probably wasn’t.” Harry looked down upon Dumbledore’s face and experienced a surge  of  savage  pleasure:  Now  he  would  know  all  the  things  that Dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him, whether Dum-bledore wanted him to or not. “You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?” said Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face. “No,” he said quietly. “No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible. I’d be dead if you hadn’t been there to help me.” He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book. Its spine was stiff; it had clearly never been opened before. He  riffled  through  the  pages,  looking  for  photographs.  He  came (cid:145) 352 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LIFE  AND  LIES  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE across  the  one  he  sought  almost  at  once,  the  young  Dumbledore and his handsome companion, roaring with laughter at some long-forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the caption. Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother’s death, with his friend Gellert Grindelwald. Harry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindel-wald.  His  friend  Grindelwald.  He  looked  sideways  at  Hermione, who was still contemplating the name as though she could not be-lieve her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry. “Grindelwald?” Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages around them for a recurrence of that fatal name. He soon dis-covered it and read greedily, but became lost: It was necessary to go further back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found himself at the start of a chapter entitled “The Greater Good.” Together, he and Hermione started to read: Now  approaching  his  eighteenth  birthday,  Dumbledore  left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory — Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of  the  Barnabus  Finkley  Prize  for  Exceptional  Spell-Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal-Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. Dumbledore intended, next, to  take  a  Grand  Tour  with  Elphias  “Dogbreath”  Doge,  the dim-witted but devoted sidekick he had picked up at school. The two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London, preparing to depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived bearing news of Dumbledore’s mother’s (cid:145) 353 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHTEEN death. “Dogbreath” Doge, who refused to be interviewed for this book, has given the public his own sentimental version of what happened next. He represents Kendra’s death as a tragic blow, and Dumbledore’s decision to give up his expedition as an act of noble self-sacrifice. Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godric’s Hollow at once, supposedly  to  “care”  for  his  younger  brother  and  sister.  But how much care did he actually give them? “He  were  a  head  case,  that  Aberforth,”  says  Enid  Smeek, whose family lived on the outskirts of Godric’s Hollow at that time. “Ran wild. ’Course, with his mum and dad gone you’d have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don’t think Albus was fussed about him, I never saw them together, anyway.” So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young brother? The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued im-prisonment of his sister. For, though her first jailer had died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumble-dore. Her very existence continued to be known only to those few outsiders who, like “Dogbreath” Doge, could be counted upon to believe in the story of her “ill health.” Another  such  easily  satisfied  friend  of  the  family  was Bathilda  Bagshot,  the  celebrated  magical  historian  who  has lived  in  Godric’s  Hollow  for  many  years.  Kendra,  of  course, had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the village. Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to Albus at Hogwarts, having been favorably im-pressed by his paper on trans-species transformation in Trans-figuration Today. This initial contact led to acquaintance with (cid:145) 354 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LIFE  AND  LIES  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE the entire Dumbledore family. At the time of Kendra’s death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric’s Hollow who was on speaking terms with Dumbledore’s mother. Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now dimmed. “The fire’s lit, but the cauldron’s empty,” as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek’s slightly earthier phrase, “She’s nutty as squirrel poo.” Never-theless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled  me  to  extract  enough  nuggets  of  hard  fact  to  string together the whole scandalous story. Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra’s premature death down to a backfiring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also parrots the family  line  on  Ariana,  calling  her  “frail”  and  “delicate.”  On one subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into procuring Veritaserum, for she, and she alone, knows the full story of the best-kept secret of Albus Dumbledore’s life. Now revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family. The  very  same  summer  that  Dumbledore  went  home  to Godric’s  Hollow,  now  an  orphan  and  head  of  the  family, Bathilda  Bagshot  agreed  to  accept  into  her  home  her  great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald. The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a genera-tion later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended (cid:145) 355 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHTEEN his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here. Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than  channel  his  abilities  into  the  attainment  of  awards  and prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was expelled. Hitherto,  all  that  has  been  known  of  Grindelwald’s  next movements is that he “traveled abroad for some months.” It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his great-aunt in Godric’s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore. “He  seemed  a  charming  boy  to  me,”  babbles  Bathilda, “whatever he became later. Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own age. The boys took to each other at once.” They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her, that Albus Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night. “Yes, even after they’d spent all day in discussion — both such  brilliant  young  boys,  they  got  on  like  a  cauldron  on fire — I’d sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert’s bedroom window,  delivering  a  letter  from  Albus!  An  idea  would  have struck him, and he had to let Gellert know immediately!” And  what  ideas  they  were.  Profoundly  shocking  though (cid:145) 356 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LIFE  AND  LIES  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE Albus Dumbledore’s fans will find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.) Gellert — Your  point  about  Wizard  dominance  being  FOR THE  MUGGLES’  OWN  GOOD — this, I think, is the cru-cial  point.  Yes,  we  have  been  given  power  and  yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us  responsibilities  over  the  ruled.  We  must  stress  this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build.  Where  we  are  opposed,  as  we  surely  will  be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We seize control  FOR  THE  GREATER  GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your  mistake  at  Durmstrang!  But  I  do  not  complain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.) Albus Astonished  and  appalled  though  his  many  admirers  will be, this letter constitutes proof that Albus Dumbledore once dreamed of overthrowing the Statute of Secrecy and establish-ing Wizard rule over Muggles. What a blow for those who have always  portrayed  Dumbledore  as  the  Muggle-borns’  greatest champion!  How  hollow  those  speeches  promoting  Muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How despicable does Albus Dumbledore  appear,  busy  plotting  his (cid:145) 357 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHTEEN rise to power when he should have been mourning his mother and caring for his sister! No  doubt  those  determined  to  keep  Dumbledore  on  his crumbling pedestal will bleat that he did not, after all, put his plans into action, that he must have suffered a change of heart,  that  he  came  to  his  senses.  However,  the  truth  seems altogether more shocking. Barely two months into their great new friendship, Dum-bledore and Grindelwald parted, never to see each other again until they met for their legendary duel (for more, see chapter 22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore come to his senses? Had he told Grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans? Alas, no. “It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,” says Bathilda. “It came as an awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he came back to my house all of a dither, told me he wanted to go home the next day. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I saw of him. “Albus was beside himself at Ariana’s death. It was so dread-ful  for  those  two  brothers.  They  had  lost  everybody  except each  other.  No  wonder  tempers  ran  a  little  high.  Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these dread-ful circumstances. But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus’s nose at the funeral was not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting like that, across her daughter’s body. A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral. . . . He would have been a comfort to Albus, at least. . . .” (cid:145) 358 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LIFE  AND  LIES  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE This  dreadful  coffin-side  brawl,  known  only  to  those  few who attended Ariana Dumbledore’s funeral, raises several ques-tions.  Why  exactly  did  Aberforth  Dumbledore  blame  Albus for his sister’s death? Was it, as “Batty” pretends, a mere effu-sion of grief? Or could there have been some more concrete reason  for  his  fury?  Grindelwald,  expelled  from  Durmstrang for  near-fatal  attacks  upon  fellow  students,  fled  the  country hours after the girl’s death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until forced to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world. Neither  Dumbledore  nor  Grindelwald  ever  seems  to  have referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life. How-ever,  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  Dumbledore  delayed,  for some  five  years  of  turmoil,  fatalities,  and  disappearances,  his attack  upon  Gellert  Grindelwald.  Was  it  lingering  affection for  the  man  or  fear  of  exposure  as  his  once  best  friend  that caused  Dumbledore  to  hesitate?  Was  it  only  reluctantly  that Dumbledore  set  out  to  capture  the  man  he  was  once  so  de-lighted he had met? And  how  did  the  mysterious  Ariana  die?  Was  she  the  in-advertent  victim  of  some  Dark  rite?  Did  she  stumble  across something she ought not to have done, as the two young men sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? Is it possible  that  Ariana  Dumbledore  was  the  first  person  to  die “for the greater good”?  The  chapter  ended  here  and  Harry  looked  up.  Hermione  had reached  the  bottom  of  the  page  before  him.  She  tugged  the  book out  of  Harry’s  hands,  looking  a  little  alarmed  by  his  expression, (cid:145) 359 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHTEEN and  closed  it  without  looking  at  it,  as  though  hiding  something indecent. “Harry —” But he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside  him;  it  was  exactly  as  he  had  felt  after  Ron  left.  He  had trusted  Dumbledore,  believed  him  the  embodiment  of  goodness and wisdom. All was ashes: How much more could he lose? Ron, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand . . . “Harry.” She seemed to have heard his thoughts. “Listen to me. It — it doesn’t make very nice reading —” “Yeah, you could say that —” “— but don’t forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter writing.” “You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn’t you?” “Yes, I — I did.” She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in  her  cold  hands.  “I  think  that’s  the  worst  bit.  I  know  Bathilda thought  it  was  all  just  talk,  but  ‘For  the  Greater  Good’  became Grindelwald’s slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he com-mitted later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say ‘For the Greater Good’ was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard.” “What’s Nurmengard?” “The  prison  Grindelwald  had  built  to  hold  his  opponents.  He ended up in there himself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Any-way,  it’s  —  it’s  an  awful  thought  that  Dumbledore’s  ideas  helped Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita can’t pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young, and —” “I thought you’d say that,” said Harry. He did not want to let his anger spill out at her, but it was hard to keep his voice steady. “I (cid:145) 360 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LIFE  AND  LIES  OF ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE thought you’d say ‘They were young.’ They were the same age as we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles.” His temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood up and walked around, trying to work some of it off. “I’m not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,” said Hermi-one. “All that ‘right to rule’ rubbish, it’s ‘Magic Is Might’ all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck alone in the house —” “Alone? He wasn’t alone! He had his brother and sister for com-pany, his Squib sister he was keeping locked up —” “I don’t believe it,” said Hermione. She stood up too. “Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib. The Dum-bledore we knew would never, ever have allowed —” “The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to conquer Muggles  by  force!”  Harry  shouted,  his  voice  echoing  across  the empty  hilltop,  and  several  blackbirds  rose  into  the  air,  squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky. “He changed, Harry, he changed! It’s as simple as that! Maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for Muggle protection and Muggle-born rights, who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who died trying to bring him down!” Rita’s book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus Dumbledore smiled dolefully at both. “Harry, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so angry is that Dumbledore never told you any of this himself.” (cid:145) 361 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  EIGHTEEN “Maybe I am!” Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his head, hardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. “Look what  he  asked  from  me,  Hermione!  Risk  your  life,  Harry!  And again! And again! And don’t expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I’m doing, trust me even though I don’t trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!” His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and the emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky. “He loved you,” Hermione whispered. “I know he loved you.” Harry dropped his arms. “I don’t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn’t love, the mess he’s left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me.” Harry picked up Hermione’s wand, which he had dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the entrance of the tent. “Thanks  for  the  tea.  I’ll  finish  the  watch.  You  get  back  in  the warm.” She  hesitated,  but  recognized  the  dismissal.  She  picked  up  the book and then walked back past him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. He closed his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared. (cid:145) 362 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  N I N E T E E N THE SILVER DOE     I t was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch at  midnight.  Harry’s  dreams  were  confused  and  disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of them, first through a gigantic, cracked ring,  then  through  a  wreath  of  Christmas  roses.  He  woke  repeat-edly,  panicky,  convinced  that  somebody  had  called  out  to  him  in the  distance,  imagining  that  the  wind  whipping  around  the  tent was footsteps or voices. Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand. The snow was still falling thickly, and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on. “We’ll go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed, shivering as she pulled  on  a  sweatshirt  over  her  pajamas.  “I  kept  thinking  I  could hear people moving outside. I even thought I saw somebody once or twice.”  (cid:145) 363 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table. “I’m sure I imagined it,” said Hermione, looking nervous. “The snow in the dark, it plays tricks on your eyes. . . . But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?” Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Hor-crux, and Hermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The  usual  tightness  engulfed  them;  Harry’s  feet  parted  company with  the  snowy  ground,  then  slammed  hard  onto  what  felt  like frozen earth covered with leaves. “Where  are  we?”  he  asked,  peering  around  at  a  fresh  mass  of trees  as  Hermione  opened  the  beaded  bag  and  began  tugging  out tent poles. “The Forest of Dean,” she said. “I came camping here once with my mum and dad.” Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at least protected from the wind. They spent most of  the  day  inside  the  tent,  huddled  for  warmth  around  the  useful bright blue flames that Hermione was so adept at producing, and which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, an impression reinforced by Hermione’s solicitousness. That afternoon fresh  flakes  drifted  down  upon  them,  so  that  even  their  sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow. After two nights of little sleep, Harry’s senses seemed more alert than usual. Their escape from Godric’s Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more threaten-ing. As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione’s offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed. (cid:145) 364 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The dark-ness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impen-etrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder’s Map, so as to watch Ginny’s dot for a while, before he remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow. Every  tiny  movement  seemed  magnified  in  the  vastness  of  the forest.  Harry  knew  that  it  must  be  full  of  living  creatures,  but  he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could sepa-rate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other, sinister movements. He remembered the sound of a  cloak  slithering  over  dead  leaves  many  years  ago,  and  at  once thought  he  heard  it  again  before  mentally  shaking  himself.  Their protective  enchantments  had  worked  for  weeks;  why  should  they break now? And yet he could not throw off the feeling that some-thing was different tonight. Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent.  The  night  reached  such  a  depth  of  velvety  blackness  that  he might  have  been  suspended  in  limbo  between  Disapparition  and Apparition. He had just held up a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened. A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift toward him. He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione’s wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blind-ing,  the  trees  in  front  of  it  pitch-black  in  silhouette,  and  still  the thing came closer. . . . (cid:145) 365 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN And  then  the  source  of  the  light  stepped  out  from  behind  an oak.  It  was  a  silver-white  doe,  moon-bright  and  dazzling,  picking her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high. Harry  stared  at  the  creature,  filled  with  wonder,  not  at  her strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew,  he  would  have  staked  his  life  on  it,  that  she  had  come  for him, and him alone. They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away. “No,” he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. “Come back!” She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her brightness was striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit. Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her properly. And then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know. At last, she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward   (cid:145) 366 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE him once more, and he broke into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished. Though  the  darkness  had  swallowed  her  whole,  her  burnished image  was  still  imprinted  on  his  retinas;  it  obscured  his  vision, brightening  when  he  lowered  his  eyelids,  disorienting  him.  Now fear came: Her presence had meant safety. “Lumos!” he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited. The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crack-les of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching him? He  held  the  wand  higher.  Nobody  ran  out  at  him,  no  flash  of green light burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot? Something  gleamed  in  the  light  of  the  wand,  and  Harry  spun about,  but  all  that  was  there  was  a  small,  frozen  pool,  its  cracked black surface glittering as he raised the wand higher to examine it. He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross . . . His heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the pool’s edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red . . . It was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. . . . The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool. Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible?   (cid:145) 367 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN How could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, where was the person who had wanted to pass it  to  Harry?  Again  he  directed  the  wand  at  the  surrounding  trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool. He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, “Accio Sword.” It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy, the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help. “Help,”  he  murmured,  but  the  sword  remained  upon  the  pool bottom, indifferent, motionless. What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumble-dore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry’s head answered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart. Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice. (cid:145) 368 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was con-vinced now that nobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of oppor-tunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting. With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where “chivalry” entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead. An  owl  hooted  somewhere  as  he  stripped  off,  and  he  thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chatter-ing horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch containing his wand, his mother’s letter, the shard of Sirius’s mirror, and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed Hermione’s wand at the ice. “Diffindo.” It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence: The surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled wa-ter. As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely. Contemplating  the  task  ahead  would  not  make  it  easier  or  the water warmer. He stepped to the pool’s edge and placed Hermione’s wand on the ground, still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering, he jumped. Every pore of his body screamed in protest: The very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He could hardly breathe; trembling so violently (cid:145) 369 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade with his numb feet. He only wanted to dive once. Harry put off the moment of total  submersion  from  second  to second, gasping and shaking, until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage, and dived. The  cold  was  agony:  It  attacked  him  like  fire.  His  brain  itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers closed around the hilt; he pulled it upward. Then something closed tight around his neck. He thought of wa-ter weeds, though nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised his empty hand to free himself. It was not weed: The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe. Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the sur-face, but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing,  suffocating,  he  scrabbled  at  the  strangling  chain,  his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were pop-ping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Death’s. . . . Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere close by, another  person  was  panting  and  coughing  and  staggering  around. Hermione  had  come  again,  as  she  had  come  when  the  snake  at-tacked. . . . Yet it did not sound like her, not with those deep coughs, not judging by the weight of the footsteps. . . . Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior’s identity. All  he  could  do  was  raise  a  shaking hand  to  his  throat  and  feel  the place  where  the  locket  had  cut  tightly  into  his  flesh.  It  was  gone: (cid:145) 370 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from over his head. “Are — you — mental?” Nothing  but  the  shock  of  hearing  that  voice  could  have  given Harry the strength to get up. Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other. “Why  the  hell,”  panted  Ron,  holding  up  the  Horcrux,  which swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, “didn’t you take this thing off before you dived?” Harry  could  not  answer.  The  silver  doe  was  nothing,  nothing compared with Ron’s reappearance; he could not believe it. Shud-dering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water’s edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to be real: He had just dived into the pool, he had saved Harry’s life. “It was y-you?” Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual due to his near-strangulation. “Well, yeah,” said Ron, looking slightly confused. “Y-you cast that doe?” “What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!” “My Patronus is a stag.” “Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.” Harry  put  Hagrid’s  pouch  back  around  his  neck,  pulled  on  a final sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione’s wand, and faced Ron again. (cid:145) 371 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN “How come you’re here?” Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all. “Well, I’ve — you know — I’ve come back. If —” He cleared his throat. “You know. You still want me.” There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron’s departure seemed to rise like a wall between them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved Harry’s life. Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding. “Oh yeah, I got it out,” he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the  sword  for  Harry’s  inspection.  “That’s  why  you  jumped  in, right?” “Yeah,” said Harry. “But I don’t understand. How did you get here? How did you find us?” “Long story,” said Ron. “I’ve been looking for you for hours, it’s a big forest, isn’t it? And I was just thinking I’d have to kip under a tree  and  wait  for  morning  when  I  saw  that  deer  coming  and  you following.” “You didn’t see anyone else?” “No,” said Ron. “I —” But  he  hesitated,  glancing  at  two  trees  growing  close  together some yards away. “I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come up, so I wasn’t going to make a detour to — hey!” Harry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated. The two oaks grew close together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level, an ideal place to see but not be seen. (cid:145) 372 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux. “Anything there?” Ron asked. “No,” said Harry. “So how did the sword get in that pool?” “Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.” They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glint-ing a little in the light from Hermione’s wand. “You reckon this is the real one?” asked Ron. “One way to find out, isn’t there?” said Harry. The  Horcrux  was  still  swinging  from  Ron’s  hand.  The  locket was  twitching  slightly.  Harry  knew  that  the  thing  inside  it  was agitated  again.  It  had  sensed  the  presence  of  the  sword  and  had tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy the locket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione’s wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree. “Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock’s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head. “No, you should do it.” “Me?” said Ron, looking shocked. “Why?” “Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it’s supposed to be you.” He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something (cid:145) 373 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN about  certain  kinds  of  magic,  of  the  incalculable  power  of  certain acts. “I’m going to open it,” said Harry, “and you stab it. Straightaway, okay?  Because  whatever’s  in  there  will  put  up  a  fight.  The  bit  of Riddle in the diary tried to kill me.” “How are you going to open it?” asked Ron. He looked terrified. “I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,” said Harry. The answer came so readily to his lips that he thought that he had always known it deep down: Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S, inlaid with glittering green stones: It was easy to visualize it as a minuscule snake, curled upon the cold rock. “No!” said Ron. “No, don’t open it! I’m serious!” “Why  not?”  asked  Harry.  “Let’s  get  rid  of  the  damn  thing,  it’s been months —” “I can’t, Harry, I’m serious — you do it —” “But why?” “Because that thing’s bad for me!” said Ron, backing away from the locket on the rock. “I can’t handle it! I’m not making excuses, Harry, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affected you and Hermione, it made me think stuff — stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse, I can’t explain it, and then I’d take it off and I’d get my head on straight again, and then I’d have to put the effing thing back on — I can’t do it, Harry!” He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head. “You can do it,” said Harry, “you can! You’ve just got the sword, I know it’s supposed to be you who uses it. Please, just get rid of it, Ron.” (cid:145) 374 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swal-lowed, then, still breathing hard through his long nose, moved back toward the rock. “Tell me when,” he croaked. “On three,” said Harry, looking back down at the locket and nar-rowing his eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach. It would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry’s neck still burned. “One . . . two . . . three . . . open.” The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide with a little click. Behind  both  of  the  glass  windows  within  blinked  a  living  eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle’s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupiled. “Stab,” said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock. Ron  raised  the  sword  in  his  shaking  hands:  The  point  dangled over  the  frantically  swiveling  eyes,  and  Harry  gripped  the  locket tightly, bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows. Then a voice hissed from out of the Horcrux. “I have seen your heart, and it is mine.” “Don’t listen to it!” Harry said harshly. “Stab it!” “I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible. . . .” “Stab!”  shouted  Harry;  his  voice  echoed  off  the  surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle’s eyes. “Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . . Least (cid:145) 375 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend . . . Second best, always, eternally overshadowed . . .” “Ron,  stab  it  now!”  Harry  bellowed:  He  could  feel  the  locket quivering  in  his  grip  and  was  scared  of  what  was  coming.  Ron raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, Riddle’s eyes gleamed scarlet. Out of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed, like  two  grotesque  bubbles,  the  heads  of  Harry  and  Hermione, weirdly distorted. Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, swaying over Ron  and  the  real  Harry,  who  had  snatched  his  fingers  away  from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot. “Ron!” he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with Voldemort’s voice and Ron was gazing, mesmerized, into its face. “Why  return?  We  were  better  without  you,  happier  without  you, glad of your absence. . . . We laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption —” “Presumption!”  echoed  the  Riddle-Hermione,  who  was  more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real Hermione: She swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified yet transfixed, the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. “Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, com-pared  with  the  Chosen  One?  What  are  you,  compared  with  the  Boy Who Lived?” “Ron, stab it, STAB IT!” Harry yelled, but Ron did not move: His eyes were wide, and the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione   (cid:145) 376 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE were  reflected  in  them,  their  hair  swirling  like  flames,  their  eyes shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet. “Your  mother  confessed,”  sneered  Riddle-Harry,  while  Riddle-Hermione jeered, “that she would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange . . .” “Who  wouldn’t  prefer  him,  what  woman  would  take  you,  you  are nothing,  nothing,  nothing  to  him,”  crooned  Riddle-Hermione,  and she  stretched  like  a  snake  and  entwined  herself  around  Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met. On the ground in front of them, Ron’s face filled with anguish. He raised the sword high, his arms shaking. “Do it, Ron!” Harry yelled. Ron  looked  toward  him,  and  Harry  thought  he  saw  a  trace  of scarlet in his eyes. “Ron — ?” The sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out of the way, there  was  a  clang  of  metal  and  a  long,  drawn-out  scream.  Harry whirled  around,  slipping  in  the  snow,  wand  held  ready  to  defend himself: but there was nothing to fight. The  monstrous  versions  of  himself  and  Hermione  were  gone: There was only Ron, standing there with the sword held slackly in his  hand,  looking  down  at  the  shattered  remains  of  the  locket  on the flat rock. Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do. Ron was breathing heavily: His eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue; they were also wet. Harry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced the glass in both windows:   (cid:145) 377 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN Riddle’s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished; torturing Ron had been its final act. The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off. “After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone . . .” He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them. “She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I thought you knew.” Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron’s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to Ron, who clam-bered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed. “I’m sorry,” he said in a thick voice. “I’m sorry I left. I know I was a — a —” He  looked  around  at  the  darkness,  as  if  hoping  a  bad  enough word would swoop down upon him and claim him.  (cid:145) 378 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE “You’ve sort of made up for it tonight,” said Harry. “Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux. Saving my life.” “That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,” Ron mumbled. “Stuff  like  that  always  sounds  cooler  than  it  really  was,”  said Harry. “I’ve been trying to tell you that for years.” Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back of Ron’s jacket. “And now,” said Harry as they broke apart, “all we’ve got to do is find the tent again.” But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy, with Ron by his side the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent, Ron lagging a little behind him. It  was  gloriously  warm  after  the  pool  and  the  forest,  the  only illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not move until Harry had said her name several times. “Hermione!” She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face. “What’s wrong? Harry? Are you all right?” “It’s okay, everything’s fine. More than fine. I’m great. There’s someone here.” “What do you mean? Who — ?” She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. Harry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron’s rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas. Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker   (cid:145) 379 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale face. She stopped right in front of  him,  her  lips  slightly  parted,  her  eyes  wide.  Ron  gave  a  weak, hopeful smile and half raised his arms. Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could reach. “Ouch — ow — gerroff! What the — ? Hermione — OW!” “You — complete — arse — Ronald — Weasley!” She punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shield-ing his head as Hermione advanced. “You  —  crawl  —  back  —  here  —  after  —  weeks  —  and  — weeks — oh, where’s my wand?” She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry’s hands and he reacted instinctively. “Protego!” The  invisible  shield  erupted  between  Ron  and  Hermione:  The force of it knocked her backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she leapt up again. “Hermione!” said Harry. “Calm —” “I will not calm down!” she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; she looked quite demented. “Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!” “Hermione, will you please —” “Don’t  you  tell  me  what  to  do,  Harry  Potter!”  she  screeched. “Don’t you dare! Give it back now! And YOU!” She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a maledic-tion, and Harry could not blame Ron for retreating several steps. “I  came  running  after  you!  I  called you!  I  begged  you to  come back!” “I know,” Ron said, “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really —” (cid:145) 380 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE “Oh, you’re sorry!” She laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but Harry merely grimaced his helplessness. “You come back after weeks — weeks — and you think it’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry?” “Well,  what  else  can  I  say?”  Ron  shouted,  and  Harry  was  glad that Ron was fighting back. “Oh, I don’t know!” yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. “Rack your brains, Ron, that should only take a couple of seconds —” “Hermione,” interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, “he just saved my —” “I don’t care!” she screamed. “I don’t care what he’s done! Weeks and weeks, we could have been dead for all he knew —” “I  knew  you  weren’t  dead!”  bellowed  Ron,  drowning  her  voice for  the  first  time,  and  approaching  as  close  as  he  could  with  the Shield Charm between them. “Harry’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental  stories,  I  knew  I’d  hear  straight  off  if  you  were  dead,  you don’t know what it’s been like —” “What it’s been like for you?” Her voice was  now so  shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a level of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his opportunity. “I  wanted  to  come  back  the  minute  I’d  Disapparated,  but  I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn’t go anywhere!” “A gang of what?” asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed un-likely that she would unravel them for several years. (cid:145) 381 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN “Snatchers,”  said  Ron.  “They’re  everywhere  —  gangs  trying  to earn gold by rounding up Muggle-borns and blood traitors, there’s a  reward  from  the  Ministry  for  everyone  captured.  I  was  on  my own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, thought I was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry.” “What did you say to them?” “Told  them  I  was  Stan  Shunpike.  First  person  I  could  think of.” “And they believed that?” “They weren’t the brightest. One of them was definitely part troll, the smell off him. . . .” Ron glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of humor, but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs. “Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them and only one of me and they’d taken my wand. Then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. I didn’t do it so well, Splinched myself again” — Ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails;  Hermione  raised  her  eyebrows  coldly  —  “and  I  came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank where we’d been . . . you’d gone.” “Gosh, what a gripping story,” Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to wound. “You must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric’s Hollow and, let’s think,   (cid:145) 382 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE what  happened  there,  Harry?  Oh  yes,  You-Know-Who’s  snake turned  up,  it  nearly  killed  both  of  us,  and  then  You-Know-Who himself arrived and missed us by about a second.” “What?”  Ron  said,  gaping  from  her  to  Harry,  but  Hermione ignored him. “Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into perspective, doesn’t it?” “Hermione,” said Harry quietly, “Ron just saved my life.” She appeared not to have heard him. “One thing I would like to know, though,” she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron’s head. “How exactly did you find us tonight? That’s important. Once we know, we’ll be able to make sure we’re not visited by anyone else we don’t want to see.” Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. “This.” She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them. “The  Deluminator?”  she  asked,  so  surprised  she  forgot  to  look cold and fierce. “It  doesn’t  just  turn  the  lights  on  and  off,”  said  Ron.  “I  don’t know  how  it  works  or  why  it  happened  then  and  not  any  other time, because I’ve been wanting to come back ever since I left. But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard . . . I heard you.” He was looking at Hermione. “You heard me on the radio?” she asked incredulously. “No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,” he held up the Deluminator again, “came out of this.”  (cid:145) 383 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN “And what exactly did I say?” asked Hermione, her tone some-where between skepticism and curiosity. “My  name.  ‘Ron.’  And  you  said  .  .  .  something  about  a wand. . . .” Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered: It had been the first time Ron’s name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left; Hermione had mentioned it when talking about repairing Harry’s wand. “So I took it out,” Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, “and it didn’t seem different or anything, but I was sure I’d heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside the window.” Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see. “It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you know?” “Yeah,” said Harry and Hermione together automatically. “I knew this was it,” said Ron. “I grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden. “The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it . . . well, it went inside me.” “Sorry?” said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly. “It sort of floated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating the move-ment with his free index finger, “right to my chest, and then — it just went straight through. It was here,” he touched a point close to his heart, “I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me I knew what I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where   (cid:145) 384 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere. . . .” “We were there,” said Harry. “We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!” “Yeah, well, that would’ve been me,” said Ron. “Your protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn’t see you and I couldn’t hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you’d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.” “No, actually,” said Hermione. “We’ve been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early, because, as Harry says, we’d heard somebody blundering around.” “Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said Ron. “I kept hoping you’d appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you,  so  I  clicked  the  Deluminator  again,  the  blue  light  came  out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn’t see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end — and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.” “You saw the what?” said Hermione sharply. They explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together. “But it must have been a Patronus!” she said. “Couldn’t you see who was casting it? Didn’t you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can’t believe this! Then what happened?”  (cid:145) 385 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  NINETEEN Ron  explained  how  he  had  watched  Harry  jump  into  the  pool and had waited for him to resurface; how he had realized that some-thing was wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, then returned for the sword.  He  got  as  far  as  the  opening  of  the  locket,  then  hesitated, and Harry cut in. “— and Ron stabbed it with the sword.” “And . . . and it went? Just like that?” she whispered. “Well, it — it screamed,” said Harry with half a glance at Ron. “Here.” wand?” He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows. Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of Hermione’s wand and turned to Ron. “Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare “What?” said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket. “Oh — oh yeah.” He  tugged  open  a  buckle  on  his  rucksack  and  pulled  a  short, dark wand out of its pocket. “Here. I figured it’s always handy to have a backup.” “You  were  right,”  said  Harry,  holding  out  his  hand.  “Mine’s broken.” “You’re kidding?” Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked apprehensive again. Hermione  put  the  vanquished  Horcrux  into  the  beaded  bag, then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another word. Ron passed Harry the new wand. “About the best you could hope for, I think,” murmured Harry. (cid:145) 386 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SILVER  DOE “Yeah,” said Ron. “Could’ve been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?” “I still haven’t ruled it out,” came Hermione’s muffled voice from beneath  her  blankets,  but  Harry  saw  Ron  smiling  slightly  as  he pulled his maroon pajamas out of his rucksack. (cid:145) 387 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E N T Y  XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD    H arry  had  not  expected  Hermione’s  anger  to  abate  over-night,  and  was  therefore  unsurprised  that  she  com-municated  mainly  by  dirty  looks  and  pointed  silences  the  next morning.  Ron  responded  by  maintaining  an  unnaturally  somber demeanor  in  her  presence  as  an  outward  sign  of  continuing  re-morse.  In  fact,  when  all  three  of  them  were  together  Harry  felt like  the  only  non-mourner  at  a  poorly  attended  funeral.  During those few moments he spent alone with Harry, however (collect-ing  water  and  searching  the  undergrowth  for  mushrooms),  Ron became shamelessly cheery. “Someone helped us,” he kept saying. “Someone sent that doe. Someone’s on our side. One Horcrux down, mate!” Bolstered  by  the  destruction  of  the  locket,  they  set  to  debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed the matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, cer-tain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione’s (cid:145) 388 (cid:145) \\x0cXENOPHILIUS  LOVEGOOD sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of Gryffindor’s sword, and above all, Ron’s return, made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face. Late  in  the  afternoon  he  and  Ron  escaped  Hermione’s  baleful presence again, and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione’s various wanderings, right up to the full story of  what  had  happened  at  Godric’s  Hollow;  Ron  was  now  filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizard-ing world during his weeks away. “. . . and how did you find out about the Taboo?” he asked Harry after  explaining  the  many  desperate  attempts  of  Muggle-borns  to evade the Ministry. “The what?” “You  and  Hermione  have  stopped  saying  You-Know-Who’s name!” “Oh,  yeah.  Well,  it’s  just  a  bad  habit  we’ve  slipped  into,”  said Harry. “But I haven’t got a problem calling him V —” “NO!”  roared  Ron,  causing  Harry  to  jump  into  the  hedge  and Hermione  (nose  buried  in  a  book  at  the  tent  entrance)  to  scowl over at them. “Sorry,” said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, “but the name’s been jinxed, Harry, that’s how they track people!  Using  his  name  breaks  protective  enchantments,  it  causes some kind of magical disturbance — it’s how they found us in Tot-tenham Court Road!” “Because we used his name?” “Exactly! You’ve got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was (cid:145) 389 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY only people who were serious about standing up to him, like Dum-bledore, who ever dared use it. Now they’ve put a Taboo on it, any-one  who  says  it  is  trackable  —  quick-and-easy  way  to  find  Order members! They nearly got Kingsley —” “You’re kidding?” “Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his way out. He’s on the run now, just like us.” Ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand. “You don’t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?” “His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?” “Oh yeah . . .” They  moved  farther  along  the  hedge,  away  from  the  tent  and Hermione. “Harry . . . you don’t reckon it could’ve been Dumbledore?” “Dumbledore what?” Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, “Dum-bledore . . . the doe? I mean,” Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, “he had the real sword last, didn’t he?” Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing behind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had man-aged to come back to them, that he was watching over them, would have been inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head. “Dumbledore’s dead,” he said. “I saw it happen, I saw the body. He’s  definitely  gone.  Anyway,  his  Patronus  was  a  phoenix,  not  a doe.” “Patronuses can change, though, can’t they?” said Ron. “Tonks’s changed, didn’t it?” “Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn’t he show him-self? Why wouldn’t he just hand us the sword?” (cid:145) 390 (cid:145) \\x0cXENOPHILIUS  LOVEGOOD “Search me,” said Ron. “Same reason he didn’t give it to you while he was alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kids’ stories?” “Which is what?” asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face, desperate for the answer. “I dunno,” said Ron. “Sometimes I’ve thought, when I’ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or — or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don’t think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he? He — well,” Ron’s ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in  a  tuft  of  grass  at  his  feet,  which  he  prodded  with  his  toe,  “he must’ve known I’d run out on you.” “No,”  Harry  corrected  him.  “He  must’ve  known  you’d  always want to come back.” Ron looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the sub-ject,  Harry  said,  “Speaking  of  Dumbledore,  have  you  heard  what Skeeter wrote about him?” “Oh yeah,” said Ron at once, “people are talking about it quite a lot. ’Course, if things were different, it’d be huge news, Dumble-dore  being  pals  with  Grindelwald,  but  now  it’s  just  something  to laugh about for people who didn’t like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke. I don’t know that it’s such a big deal, though. He was really young when they —” “Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something  in  his  face  seemed  to  decide  Ron  against  pursuing  the subject. A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous (cid:145) 391 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY night,  which  Hermione  had  since  condescended  to  examine,  and had decided was made of blackthorn. “Engorgio.” The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger. “Stop that,” said Ron sharply. “I’m sorry I said Dumbledore was young, okay?” Harry had forgotten Ron’s hatred of spiders. “Sorry — Reducio.” The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand.  Every  minor  spell  he  had  cast  with  it  so  far  that  day  had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else’s hand sewn to the end of his arm. “You just need to practice,” said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry  tried  to  enlarge  and  reduce  the  spider.  “It’s  all  a  matter  of confidence, Harry.” He  knew  why  she  wanted  it  to  be all right: She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermi-one a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more. All  three  of  them  returned  to  the  tent  when  darkness  fell,  and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still  seemed  clumsier  and  less  powerful  than  it  had  done  before. (cid:145) 392 (cid:145) \\x0cXENOPHILIUS  LOVEGOOD Hermione  was  lying  on  her  bunk  reading,  while  Ron,  after  many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it. “There’s this one program,” he told Harry in a low voice, “that tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who’s side and are following the Ministry line, but this one . . . you wait till you hear it, it’s great. Only they can’t do it every night, they have to  keep  changing  locations  in  case  they’re  raided,  and  you  need  a password to tune in. . . . Trouble is, I missed the last one. . . .” He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand, mut-tering random words under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the no-tice she took of him he might not have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand. Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once. “If it’s annoying you, I’ll stop!” he told Hermione nervously. Hermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry. “We need to talk,” she said. He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. “What?”  he  said  apprehensively.  It  flew  through  his  mind  that there was a chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita’s version of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermi-one’s answer, however, was completely unexpected. “I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.” He stared at her. “Sorry?” (cid:145) 393 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY “Xenophilius Lovegood. Luna’s father. I want to go and talk to him!” “Er — why?” She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, “It’s that mark, the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!” She thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry’s unwilling eyes and he saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore’s famil-iar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been Rita’s invention. “The signature,” said Hermione. “Look at the signature, Harry!” He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard. “Er — what are you — ?” said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to Harry. “It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said. “I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric’s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can’t ask Dumble-dore or Grindelwald what it means — I don’t even know whether Grindelwald’s still alive — but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing  the  symbol  at  the  wedding.  I’m  sure  this  is  important, Harry!” Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager  face  and  then  out  into  the  surrounding  darkness,  thinking. (cid:145) 394 (cid:145) \\x0cXENOPHILIUS  LOVEGOOD After a long pause he said, “Hermione, we don’t need another God-ric’s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and —” “But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you know we’re not supposed to find out about the sign?” “Here  we  go  again!”  Harry  felt  slightly  exasperated.  “We  keep trying  to  convince  ourselves  Dumbledore  left  us  secret  signs  and clues —” “The  Deluminator  turned  out  to  be  pretty  useful,”  piped  up Ron.  “I  think  Hermione’s  right,  I  think  we  ought  to  go  and  see Lovegood.” Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron’s sup-port of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. “It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, “Lovegood’s on your side, Harry, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps tell-ing everyone they’ve got to help you!” “I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly. “But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?” “Maybe . . . maybe it’s something you need to find out for your-self,” said Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws. “Yeah,” said Ron sycophantically, “that makes sense.” “No, it doesn’t,” snapped Hermione, “but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grin-delwald, and Godric’s Hollow? Harry, I’m sure we ought to know about this!” “I think we should vote on it,” said Ron. “Those in favor of going to see Lovegood —” (cid:145) 395 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY His hand flew into the air before Hermione’s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own. “Outvoted, Harry, sorry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back. “Fine,” said Harry, half amused, half irritated. “Only, once we’ve seen Lovegood, let’s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegoods live, anyway? Do either of you know?” “Yeah, they’re not far from my place,” said Ron. “I dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn’t be hard to find.” When  Hermione  had  returned  to  her  bunk,  Harry  lowered  his voice. “You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.” “All’s fair in love and war,” said Ron brightly, “and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna’ll be home!” They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchpole from the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow, their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard, which afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes. “It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” said Ron. “Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,” said Hermione coldly. “I  wasn’t  at  the  Burrow!”  said  Ron  with  an  incredulous  laugh. “Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I’d walked  out  on  you?  Yeah,  Fred  and  George  would’ve  been  great about it. And Ginny, she’d have been really understanding.” (cid:145) 396 (cid:145) \\x0cXENOPHILIUS  LOVEGOOD “But where have you been, then?” asked Hermione, surprised. “Bill and Fleur’s new place. Shell Cottage. Bill’s always been de-cent  to  me.  He  —  he  wasn’t  impressed  when  he  heard  what  I’d done,  but  he  didn’t  go  on  about  it.  He  knew  I  was  really  sorry. None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren’t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You know, first holiday after they were married. I don’t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.” Ron turned his back on the Burrow. “Let’s try up here,” he said, leading the way over the top of the hill. They  walked  for  a  few  hours,  Harry,  at  Hermione’s  insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills ap-peared  to  be  uninhabited  apart  from  one  small  cottage,  which seemed deserted. “Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for Christmas?” said Hermione, peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. Ron snorted. “Listen, I’ve got a feeling you’d be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the Lovegoods’ window. Let’s try the next lot of hills.” So they Disapparated a few miles farther north. “Aha!” shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had  appeared,  where  a  most  strange-looking  house  rose  vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky. “That’s got to be Luna’s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!” (cid:145) 397 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY “It’s nothing like a bird,” said Hermione, frowning at the tower. “I was talking about a chess rook,” said Ron. “A castle to you.” Ron’s  legs  were  the  longest  and  he  reached  the  top  of  the  hill first. When Harry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they found him grinning broadly. “It’s theirs,” said Ron. “Look.” Three  hand-painted  signs  had  been  tacked  to  a  broken-down gate. The first read, THE QUIBBLER. EDITOR: X. LOVEGOOD the second, the third, PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, includ-ing  a  bush  covered  in  the  orange  radishlike  fruit  Luna  sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits  and  bushy  crowns  of  white-beaded  mistletoe,  stood  sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened, hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches. “You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,” said Hermi-one. “It’s you Mr. Lovegood wants to help, not us.” He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She then rapped three times on the thick black door, (cid:145) 398 (cid:145) \\x0cXENOPHILIUS  LOVEGOOD which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle. Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and  unkempt.  Xenophilius  had  been  positively  dapper  at  Bill  and Fleur’s wedding by comparison. “What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?” he cried in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical O. “Hello, Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “I’m Harry, Harry Potter.” Xenophilius did not take Harry’s hand, although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry’s forehead. “Would it be okay if we came in?” asked Harry. “There’s some-thing we’d like to ask you.” “I . . . I’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered Xenophilius. He swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. “Rather a shock . . . My word . . . I . . . I’m afraid I don’t really think I ought to —” “It  won’t  take  long,”  said  Harry,  slightly  disappointed  by  this less-than-warm welcome. “I — oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!” They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them. They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that it felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved (cid:145) 399 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY to fit the walls — the stove, the sink, and the cupboards — and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and birds in bright pri-mary colors. Harry thought he recognized Luna’s style: The effect, in such an enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming. In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing. “You’d better come up,” said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable, and he led the way. The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller and entirely round, the room somewhat re-sembled  the  Room  of  Requirement  on  the  unforgettable  occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon piles of books and  papers  on  every  surface.  Delicately  made  models  of  creatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling. Luna was not there: The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels. It  looked  like  the  bizarre  offspring  of  a  workbench  and  a  set  of old shelves, but after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old-fashioned  printing  press,  due  to  the  fact  that  it  was  churning  out Quibblers. “Excuse  me,”  said  Xenophilius,  and  he  strode  over  to  the  ma-chine, seized a grubby tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry. (cid:145) 400 (cid:145) \\x0cXENOPHILIUS  LOVEGOOD “Why have you come here?” Before  Harry  could  speak,  however,  Hermione  let  out  a  small cry of shock. “Mr. Lovegood — what’s that?” She  was  pointing  at  an  enormous,  gray  spiral  horn,  not  unlike that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room. “It  is  the  horn  of  a  Crumple-Horned  Snorkack,”  said  Xeno-philius. “No it isn’t!” said Hermione. “Hermione,”  muttered  Harry,  embarrassed,  “now’s  not  the moment —” “But  Harry,  it’s  an  Erumpent  horn!  It’s  a  Class  B  Tradeable Material  and  it’s  an  extraordinarily  dangerous  thing  to  have  in  a house!” “How  d’you  know  it’s  an  Erumpent  horn?”  asked  Ron,  edging away from the horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room. “There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t you know it can explode at the slightest touch?” “The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish look upon his face, “is a shy and highly magical creature, and its horn —” “Mr.  Lovegood,  I  recognize  the  grooved  markings  around  the base,  that’s  an  Erumpent  horn  and  it’s  incredibly  dangerous  —  I don’t know where you got it —” “I bought it,” said Xenophilius dogmatically, “two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite (cid:145) 401 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,” he said, turning to Harry, “why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?” “We need some help,” said Harry, before Hermione could start again. “Ah,” said Xenophilius. “Help. Hmm.” His good eye moved again to Harry’s scar. He seemed simultane-ously terrified and mesmerized. “Yes. The thing is . . . helping Harry Potter . . . rather danger-ous . . .” “Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to help Harry?” said Ron. “In that magazine of yours?” Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth. “Er — yes, I have expressed that view. However —” “That’s for everyone else to do, not you personally?” said Ron. Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle. “Where’s Luna?” asked Hermione. “Let’s see what she thinks.” Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, “Luna is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She . . . she will like to see you. I’ll go and call her and then — yes, very well. I shall try to help you.” He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close. They looked at each other. “Cowardly old wart,” said Ron. “Luna’s got ten times his guts.” “He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here,” said Harry. (cid:145) 402 (cid:145) \\x0cXENOPHILIUS  LOVEGOOD “Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione. “Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it him-self. And for heaven’s sake keep away from that horn.” Harry  crossed  to  the  window  on  the  far  side  of  the  room.  He could see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invis-ible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than they had been since Bill and Fleur’s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing to-ward her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius’s attitude proved that. He turned away from the window and his gaze fell upon another peculiar  object  standing  upon  the  cluttered,  curved  sideboard:  a stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking  headdress.  Two  objects  that  resembled  golden  ear trumpets  curved  out  from  the  sides.  A  tiny  pair  of  glittering  blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead. “Look at this,” said Harry. “Fetching,”  said  Ron.  “Surprised  he  didn’t  wear  that  to  the wedding.” They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophil-ius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encased in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming teapot. “Ah,  you  have  spotted  my  pet  invention,”  he  said,  shoving  the (cid:145) 403 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY tray  into  Hermione’s  arms  and  joining  Harry  at  the  statue’s  side. “Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowena Ravenclaw. ‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure!’ ” He indicated the objects like ear trumpets. “These are the Wrackspurt siphons — to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker’s immediate area. Here,” he pointed out the tiny wings, “a billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. Finally,” he pointed to the orange radish, “the Dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.” Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had man-aged to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables. “May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?” said Xenophil-ius.  “We  make  it  ourselves.”  As  he  started  to  pour  out  the  drink, which  was  as  deeply  purple  as  beetroot  juice,  he  added,  “Luna  is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She ought not to be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plimp-ies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar. “Now,” he removed a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, “how may I help you, Mr. Potter?” “Well,” said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encour-agingly, “it’s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur’s wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.” Xenophilius raised his eyebrows. “Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” (cid:145) 404 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E N T Y - O N E  THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS  arry  turned  to  look  at  Ron  and  Hermione.  Neither  of them  seemed  to  have  understood  what  Xenophilius  had H said either. “The Deathly Hallows?” “That’s right,” said Xenophilius. “You haven’t heard of them? I’m not surprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother’s wedding,” he nodded at Ron, “who  attacked  me  for  sporting  the  symbol  of  a  well-known  Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows — at least, not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest.” He  stirred  several  lumps  of  sugar  into  his  Gurdyroot  infusion and drank some. “I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I still don’t really understand.” To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged: (cid:145) 405 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE The  stuff  was  quite  disgusting,  as  though  someone  had  liquidized bogey-flavored Every Flavor Beans. “Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,” said Xeno-philius, smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. “But what are the Deathly Hallows?” asked Hermione. Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. “I assume that you are all familiar with “The Tale of the Three Brothers’?” philius nodded gravely. Harry said, “No,” but Ron and Hermione both said, “Yes.” Xeno-“Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’ . . . I have a copy somewhere. . . .” He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, “I’ve got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I’ve got it right here.” And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. “The original?” inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nod-ded, he said, “Well then, why don’t you read it aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all understand.” “Er . . . all right,” said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read. “ ‘There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight —’ ” “Midnight, our mum always told us,” said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. (cid:145) 406 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  TALE  OF  THE THREE  BROTHERS “Sorry, I just think it’s a bit spookier if it’s midnight!” said Ron. “Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,” said Harry before he could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at the sky. “Go on, Hermione.” “ ‘In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the  magical  arts,  and  so  they  simply  waved  their  wands  and  made  a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. “ ‘And Death spoke to them —’” “Sorry,” interjected Harry, “but Death spoke to them?” “It’s a fairy tale, Harry!” “Right, sorry. Go on.” “ ‘And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death  was  cunning.  He  pretended  to  congratulate  the  three  brothers upon  their  magic,  and  said  that  each  had  earned  a  prize  for  having been clever enough to evade him. “ ‘So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother. “ ‘Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead. (cid:145) 407 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE “ ‘And  then  Death  asked  the  third  and  youngest  brother  what  he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being fol-lowed  by  Death.  And  Death,  most  unwillingly,  handed  over  his  own Cloak of Invisibility.’ ” “Death’s got an Invisibility Cloak?” Harry interrupted again. “So he can sneak up on people,” said Ron. “Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry, Hermione.” “ ‘Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on  their  way,  and  they  did  so,  talking  with  wonder  of  the  adventure they had had, and admiring Death’s gifts. “ ‘In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. “ ‘The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quar-rel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful  wand  he  had  snatched  from  Death  himself,  and  of  how  it made him invincible. “ ‘That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother’s throat. “ ‘And so Death took the first brother for his own. “ ‘Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his   (cid:145) 408 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  TALE  OF  THE THREE  BROTHERS delight,  the  figure  of  the  girl  he  had  once  hoped  to  marry,  before  her untimely death, appeared at once before him. “ ‘Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her. “ ‘And so Death took the second brother for his own. “ ‘But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age  that  the  youngest  brother  finally  took  off  the  Cloak  of  Invisibility and gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.’ ” Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xeno-philius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he with-drew his gaze from the window and said, “Well, there you are.” “Sorry?” said Hermione, sounding confused. “Those are the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius. He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books. “The Elder Wand,” he said, and he drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. “The Resurrection Stone,” he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. “The Cloak of Invisibility,” he finished, en-closing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. “Together,” he said, “the Deathly Hallows.” “But there’s no mention of the words ‘Deathly Hallows’ in the story,” said Hermione. “Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. “That is a children’s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us   (cid:145) 409 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.” There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was low in the sky. “Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,” he said quietly. “When you say ‘master of Death’ —” said Ron. “Master,”  said  Xenophilius,  waving  an  airy  hand.  “Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.” “But then . . . do you mean . . .” said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, “that you believe these objects — these Hallows — actu-ally exist?” Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. “Well, of course.” “But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, “Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe — ?” “Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius. “You are, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded.” “Perhaps  you  ought  to  try  on  the  hat,  Hermione,”  said  Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing. “Mr. Lovegood,” Hermione began again. “We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But —” “Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Dis-illusionment  Charm,  or  carrying  a  Bedazzling  Hex,  or  else  woven (cid:145) 410 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  TALE  OF  THE THREE  BROTHERS from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and  truly  renders  the  wearer  completely  invisible,  and  endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?” Hermione  opened  her  mouth  to  answer,  then  closed  it  again, looking more confused than ever. She, Harry, and Ron glanced at  one  another,  and  Harry  knew  that  they  were  all  thinking  the same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xeno-philius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment. “Exactly,”  said  Xenophilius,  as  if  he  had  defeated  them  all  in reasoned argument. “None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?” He  glanced  out  of  the  window  again.  The  sky  was  now  tinged with the faintest trace of pink. “All right,” said Hermione, disconcerted. “Say the Cloak existed . . . what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?” “What of it?” “Well, how can that be real?” “Prove that it is not,” said Xenophilius. Hermione looked outraged. “But that’s — I’m sorry, but that’s completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn’t exist? Do you expect me to get hold of  —  of  all  the  pebbles  in  the  world  and  test  them?  I  mean,  you could claim that anything’s real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody’s proved it doesn’t exist!” (cid:145) 411 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE “Yes, you could,” said Xenophilius. “I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.” “So the Elder Wand,” said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, “you think that exists too?” “Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said Xenophil-ius. “The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, be-cause of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.” “Which is what?” asked Harry. “Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly master of it,” said Xenophil-ius. “Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him?  Of  the  dreadful  Loxias,  who  took  the  wand  from  Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.” Harry  glanced  at  Hermione.  She  was  frowning  at  Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him. “So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” asked Ron. “Alas,  who  knows?”  said  Xenophilius,  as  he  gazed  out  of  the window. “Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.” There  was  a  pause.  Finally  Hermione  asked  stiffly,  “Mr.  Love-good, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?” Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry’s   (cid:145) 412 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  TALE  OF  THE THREE  BROTHERS memory, but he could not locate it. Peverell . . . he had heard that name before. . . . “But you have been misleading me, young woman!” said Xeno-philius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. “I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything — everything! — to do with the Hallows!” “Who are the Peverells?” asked Ron. “That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s Hollow,”  said  Hermione,  still  watching  Xenophilius.  “Ignotus Peverell.” “Exactly!”  said  Xenophilius,  his  forefinger  raised  pedantically. “The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus’s grave is conclusive proof!” “Of what?” asked Ron. “Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell  brothers,  Antioch,  Cadmus,  and  Ignotus!  That  they  were the original owners of the Hallows!” With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the spiral staircase. “You will stay for dinner?” he called, as he vanished downstairs again. “Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy soup.” “Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo’s,” said Ron under his breath. Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking. “What do you think?” he asked Hermione.  (cid:145) 413 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE “Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This can’t be what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.” “I s’pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snor-kacks,” said Ron. “You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him. “Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick fights, don’t go messing around with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you’ll be okay’ Come to think of it,” Ron added, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.” “What are you talking about?” “One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.’ ‘Wand of elder, never prosper.’ You must’ve heard them. My mum’s full of them.” “Harry and I were raised by Muggles,” Hermione reminded him. “We  were  taught  different  superstitions.”  She  sighed  deeply  as  a rather  pungent  smell  drifted  up  from  the  kitchen.  The  one  good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. “I think you’re right,” she told him. “It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d choose —” The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, “the Cloak,” Ron said, “the wand,” and Harry said, “the stone.” They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused. “You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” Ron told Hermione, “but you wouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!” (cid:145) 414 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  TALE  OF  THE THREE  BROTHERS “We’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “And  it’s  helped  us  rather  a  lot,  in  case  you  hadn’t  noticed!” said  Hermione.  “Whereas  the  wand  would  be  bound  to  attract trouble —” “Only if you shouted about it,” argued Ron. “Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and singing, ‘I’ve got an unbeatable wand, come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough.’ As long as you kept your trap shut —” “Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?” said Hermione, look-ing skeptical. “You know, the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of years.” “There have?” asked Harry. Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other. “The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under differ-ent names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who’s boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but — oh, it’s all nonsense. Wands are only as pow-erful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people’s.” “But how do you know,” said Harry, “that those wands — the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny — aren’t the same wand, sur-facing over the centuries under different names?” “What, and they’re all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?” said Ron. Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after  all,  ridiculous.  His  wand,  he  reminded  himself,  had  been  of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had (cid:145) 415 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. And if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken? “So why would you take the stone?” Ron asked him. “Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius . . . Mad-Eye . . . Dumbledore . . . my parents. . . .” Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled. “But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn’t want to come back,  would  they?”  said  Harry,  thinking  about  the  tale  they  had just heard. “I don’t suppose there have been loads of other sto-ries  about  a  stone  that  can  raise  the  dead,  have  there?”  he  asked Hermione. “No,” she replied sadly. “I don’t think anyone except Mr. Love-good could kid themselves that’s possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer’s Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.” The  smell  from  the  kitchen  was  getting  stronger:  It  was  some-thing  like  burning  underpants.  Harry  wondered  whether  it  would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings. “What about the Cloak, though?” said Ron slowly. “Don’t you realize, he’s right? I’ve got so used to Harry’s Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s. It’s infallible. We’ve never been spotted under it —” “Of course not — we’re invisible when we’re under it, Ron!” “But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they’re not ex-actly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It’s never occurred to me before, but I’ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they’ve got holes in.   (cid:145) 416 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  TALE  OF  THE THREE  BROTHERS Harry’s was owned by his dad, so it’s not exactly new, is it, but it’s just . . . perfect!” “Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone . . .” As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a moment’s bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mir-ror, but a painting. Curious, he began to climb the stairs. “Harry, what are you doing? I don’t think you should look around when he’s not here!” But Harry had already reached the next level. Luna  had  decorated  her  bedroom  ceiling  with  five  beautifully painted  faces:  Harry,  Ron,  Hermione,  Ginny,  and  Neville.  They were  not  moving  as  the  portraits  at  Hogwarts  moved,  but  there was a certain magic about them all the same: Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures,  linking  them  together,  but  after  examining  them  for  a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one word, repeated  a  thousand  times  in  golden  ink:  friends  .  .  .  friends  .  .  . friends . . . Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever  seen  her  in  life.  The  picture  was  dusty.  This  struck  Harry  as slightly odd. He stared around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with   (cid:145) 417 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in  for  weeks.  A  single  cobweb  stretched  over  the  nearest  window, across a bloodred sky. “What’s wrong?” Hermione asked as Harry descended the stair-case, but before he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls. “Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry. “Where’s Luna?” “Excuse me?” “Where’s Luna?” Xenophilius halted on the top step. “I — I’ve already told you. She is down at Bottom Bridge, fish-ing for Plimpies.” “So why have you only laid that tray for four?” Xenophilius  tried  to  speak,  but  no  sound  came  out.  The  only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius’s hands shook. “I  don’t  think  Luna’s  been  here  for  weeks,”  said  Harry.  “Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn’t been slept in. Where is she? And why do you keep looking out of the window?” Xenophilius dropped the tray: The bowls bounced and smashed. Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  drew  their  wands:  Xenophilius  froze, his  hand  about  to  enter  his  pocket.  At  that  moment  the  printing press  gave  a  huge  bang  and  numerous  Quibblers  came  streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth; the press fell silent at last. Hermione  stooped  down  and  picked  up  one  of  the  magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood. “Harry, look at this.” (cid:145) 418 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  TALE  OF  THE THREE  BROTHERS He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clut-ter. The front of The Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with  the  words  Undesirable  Number  One  and  captioned  with the reward money. “The Quibbler’s going for a new angle, then?” Harry asked coldly, his  mind  working  very  fast.  “Is  that  what  you  were  doing  when you  went  into  the  garden,  Mr.  Lovegood?  Sending  an  owl  to  the Ministry?” Xenophilius licked his lips. “They took my Luna,” he whispered. “Because of what I’ve been writing. They took my Luna and I don’t know where she is, what they’ve done to her. But they might give her back to me if I — if I —” “Hand over Harry?” Hermione finished for him. “No deal,” said Ron flatly. “Get out of the way, we’re leaving.” Xenophilius  looked  ghastly,  a  century  old,  his  lips  drawn  back into a dreadful leer. “They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave.” He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sud-den vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib. “Don’t make us hurt you,” Harry said. “Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.” “HARRY!” Hermione screamed. Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized  their  mistake  just  in  time:  He  launched  himself  sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm’s way as Xenophilius’s Stun-ning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn. (cid:145) 419 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart: Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard Her-mione’s scream, Ron’s yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. Half  buried  in  rubble,  Harry  tried  to  raise  himself:  He  could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fallen in, and the end of Luna’s bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing, frag-ments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the stair-case to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger to her lips. The door downstairs crashed open. “Didn’t I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?” said a rough voice. “Didn’t I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?” There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius. “No . . . no . . . upstairs . . . Potter!” “I told you last week, Lovegood, we weren’t coming back for any-thing less than some solid information! Remember last week? When you  wanted  to  swap  your  daughter for that stupid bleeding head-dress?  And  the  week  before”  —  another  bang,  another  squeal  — “when you thought we’d give her back if you offered us proof there are Crumple” — bang — “Headed” — bang — “Snorkacks?”  (cid:145) 420 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  TALE  OF  THE THREE  BROTHERS “No — no — I beg you!” sobbed Xenophilius. “It really is Pot-ter! Really!” “And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!” roared the Death Eater, and there was a volley of bangs inter-spersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius. “The  place  looks  like  it’s  about  to  fall  in,  Selwyn,”  said  a  cool second  voice,  echoing  up  the  mangled  staircase.  “The  stairs  are completely  blocked.  Could  try  clearing  it?  Might  bring  the  place down.” “You  lying  piece  of  filth,”  shouted  the  wizard  named  Selwyn. “You’ve  never  seen  Potter  in  your  life,  have  you?  Thought  you’d lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you’ll get your girl back like this?” “I swear . . . I swear . . . Potter’s upstairs!” “Homenum revelio,” said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow. “There’s  someone  up  there  all  right,  Selwyn,”  said  the  second man sharply. “It’s Potter, I tell you, it’s Potter!” sobbed Xenophilius. “Please . . . please . . . give me Luna, just let me have Luna. . . .” “You  can  have  your  little  girl,  Lovegood,”  said  Selwyn,  “if  you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it’s a trick, if you’ve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we’ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.” Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings   (cid:145) 421 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE and scrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. “Come on,” Harry whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.” He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xeno-philius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried deepest: Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreck-age to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs.  While  Xenophilius’s  banging  and  scraping  drew  nearer  and nearer,  Hermione  managed  to  free  Ron  with  the  use  of  a  Hover Charm. “All  right,”  breathed  Hermione,  as  the  broken  printing  press blocking  the  top  of  the  stairs  began  to  tremble;  Xenophilius  was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. “Do you trust me, Harry?” Harry nodded. “Okay  then,”  Hermione  whispered,  “give  me  the  Invisibility Cloak. Ron, you’re going to put it on.” “Me? But Harry —” “Please,  Ron!  Harry,  hold  on  tight  to  my  hand,  Ron,  grab  my shoulder.” Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The  printing  press  blocking  the  stairs  was  vibrating:  Xenophilius was  trying  to  shift  it  using  a  Hover  Charm.  Harry  did  not  know what Hermione was waiting for. “Hold tight,” she whispered. “Hold tight . . . any second . . .” Xenophilius’s  paper-white  face  appeared  over  the  top  of  the sideboard. “Obliviate!”  cried  Hermione,  pointing  her  wand  first  into  his face, then at the floor beneath them. “Deprimo!” (cid:145) 422 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  TALE  OF  THE THREE  BROTHERS She  had  blasted  a  hole  in  the  sitting room floor. They fell like boulders, Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life; there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all  around  them  from  the  shattered  ceiling.  Hermione  twisted  in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry’s ears as she dragged him once more into darkness. (cid:145) 423 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E N T Y - T W O  THE DEATHLY HALLOWS    H arry  fell,  panting,  onto  grass  and  scrambled  up  at  once. They  seemed  to  have  landed  in  the  corner  of  a  field  at dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around them, wav-ing her wand. “Protego Totalum . . . Salvio Hexia . . .” “That treacherous old bleeder!” Ron panted, emerging from be-neath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. “Hermione, you’re a genius, a total genius, I can’t believe we got out of that!” “Cave Inimicum . . . Didn’t I say it was an Erumpent horn, didn’t I tell him? And now his house has been blown apart!” “Serves him right,” said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs. “What d’you reckon they’ll do to him?” “Oh, I hope they don’t kill him!” groaned Hermione. “That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!” “Why hide me, though?” asked Ron. (cid:145) 424 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS “You’re  supposed  to  be  in  bed  with  spattergroit,  Ron!  They’ve kidnapped Luna because her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew you’re with him?” “But what about your mum and dad?” “They’re in Australia,” said Hermione. “They should be all right. They don’t know anything.” “You’re a genius,” Ron repeated, looking awed. “Yeah, you are, Hermione,” agreed Harry fervently. “I don’t know what we’d do without you.” She beamed, but became solemn at once. “What about Luna?” “Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still alive —” began Ron. alive, she must!” “Don’t say that, don’t say it!” squealed Hermione. “She must be “Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said Ron. “Whether she survives the place, though . . . Loads don’t. . . .” “She will,” said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the al-ternative. “She’s tough, Luna, much tougher than you’d think. She’s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.” “I hope you’re right,” said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. “I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if —” “— if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,” said Ron. They  put  up  the  tent  and  retreated  inside  it,  where  Ron  made them tea. After their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly. “Oh, why did we go there?” groaned Hermione after a few min-utes’ silence. “Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over (cid:145) 425 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO again,  a  complete  waste  of  time!  The  Deathly  Hallows  .  .  .  such rubbish . . . although actually,” a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, “he might have made it all up, mightn’t he? He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!” “I don’t think so,” said Ron. “It’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.” “Well, I don’t suppose it matters,” sighed Hermione. “Even if he was  being  honest,  I  never  heard  such  a  lot  of  nonsense  in  all  my life.” “Hang on, though,” said Ron. “The Chamber of Secrets was sup-posed to be a myth, wasn’t it?” “But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!” “You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said Ron. “Harry’s Invisibility Cloak —” “ ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said Hermione firmly. “A  story  about  how  humans  are  frightened  of  death.  If  surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have ev-erything we need already!” “I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,” said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers. “There’s no such thing, Harry!” “You said there have been loads of wands — the Deathstick and whatever they were called —” (cid:145) 426 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS “All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real, what about the Resurrection Stone?” Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. “No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!” “When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my mum and dad appear . . . and Cedric . . .” “But  they  weren’t  really  back  from  the  dead,  were  they?”  said Hermione. “Those kinds of — of pale imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.” “But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even lived with her for a while. . . .” He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione’s expression. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared her with his talk of living with dead people. “So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,” he said hastily,  trying  to  sound  robustly  sane,  “you  don’t  know  anything about him, then?” “No,”  she  replied,  looking  relieved  at  the  change  of  subject.  “I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been any-one famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’ is  Nature’s  Nobility:  A  Wizarding  Genealogy.  I  borrowed  it  from Kreacher,”  she  explained  as  Ron  raised  his  eyebrows.  “It  lists  the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.” “ ‘Extinct in the male line’?” repeated Ron. “It means the name’s died out,” said Hermione, “centuries ago, in (cid:145) 427 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though, they’d just be called something different.” And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had  stirred  at  the  sound  of  the  name  “Peverell”:  a  filthy  old  man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, “Marvolo Gaunt!” “Sorry?” said Ron and Hermione together. “Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who’s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!” Ron and Hermione looked bewildered. “The  ring,  the  ring  that  became  the  Horcrux,  Marvolo  Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry’s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!” “The Peverell coat of arms?” said Hermione sharply. “Could you see what it looked like?” “Not really,” said Harry, trying to remember. “There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.” Harry saw Hermione’s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished. “Blimey . . . You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows?” “Why not?” said Harry excitedly. “Marvolo Gaunt was an igno-rant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not  have  known  what  it  really  was.  There  were  no  books  in  that house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of (cid:145) 428 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically royal.” “Yes . . . and that’s all very interesting,” said Hermione cautiously, “but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re think —” “Well, why not? Why not?” said Harry, abandoning caution. “It was a stone, wasn’t it?” He looked at Ron for support. “What if it was the Resurrection Stone?” Ron’s mouth fell open. “Blimey — but would it still work if Dumbledore broke — ?” “Work? Work?  Ron,  it  never  worked! There’s  no  such  thing  as  a Resurrection Stone!” Hermione had leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. “Harry, you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story —” “Fit everything in?” he repeated. “Hermione, it fits of its own ac-cord!  I  know  the  sign  of  the  Deathly  Hallows  was  on  that  stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!” “A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!” “Where d’you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry. “What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?” But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione’s. . . . Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death . . . Master . . . Conqueror . . . Vanquisher . . . The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. . . . And  he  saw  himself,  possessor  of  the  Hallows,  facing  Volde-mort, whose Horcruxes were no match . . . Neither can live while the  other  survives.  .  .  .  Was  this  the  answer?  Hallows  versus  Hor-cruxes? Was there a way, after all, to ensure that he was the one (cid:145) 429 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO who  triumphed?  If  he  were  the  master  of  the  Deathly  Hallows, would he be safe? “Harry?” But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibil-ity Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was ex-actly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders  the  wearer  completely  invisible,  and  endures  eternally,  giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. . . . And then, with a gasp, he remembered — “Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!” His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. “My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow. . . .” Harry was  walking  blindly  around  the  tent,  feeling  as  though  great  new vistas of truth were opening all around him. “He’s my ancestor! I’m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!” He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two. “Harry,”  said  Hermione  again,  but  he  was  busy  undoing  the pouch around his neck, his fingers shaking hard. “Read it,” he told her, pushing his mother’s letter into her hand. “Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment (cid:145) 430 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible with-out one!” Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He  had  dislodged  the  Snitch  when  he  pulled  out  the  letter.  He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out. “IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring — it’s in the Snitch!” “You — you reckon?” He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so  obvious,  so  clear  to  Harry:  Everything  fit,  everything.  .  .  .  His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then — But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excite-ment, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken. “That’s what he’s after.” The  change  in  his  voice  made  Ron  and  Hermione  look  even more scared. “You-Know-Who’s after the Elder Wand.” He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made sense. Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Her-mione as he looked out into the night, thinking. . . . Voldemort  had  been  raised  in  a  Muggle  orphanage.  Nobody could  have  told  him  The  Tales  of  Beedle  the  Bard  when  he  was  a child,  any  more  than  Harry  had  heard  them.  Hardly  any  wizards (cid:145) 431 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them? Harry  gazed  into  the  darkness.  .  .  .  If  Voldemort  had  known about  the  Deathly  Hallows,  surely  he  would  have  sought  them, done  anything  to  possess  them:  three  objects  that  made  the  pos-sessor  master  of  Death?  If  he  had  known  about  the  Deathly  Hal-lows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn’t the  simple  fact  that  he  had  taken  a  Hallow,  and  turned  it  into  a Horcrux,  demonstrate  that  he  did  not  know  this  last  great  Wiz-arding secret? Which  meant  that  Voldemort  sought  the  Elder  Wand  without realizing  its  full  power,  without  understanding  that  it  was  one  of three . . . for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden, whose existence was best known. . . . The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history . . . Harry  watched  the  cloudy  sky,  curves  of  smoke-gray  and  silver sliding over the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermi-one standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily’s  letter,  Ron  at  her  side  looking  slightly  anxious.  Didn’t  they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes? “This is it,” Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own  astonished  certainty.  “This  explains  everything.  The  Deathly Hallows are real, and I’ve got one — maybe two —” He held up the Snitch. “— and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he doesn’t real-ize . . . he just thinks it’s a powerful wand —” “Harry,” said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him (cid:145) 432 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS back Lily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.” “But don’t you see? It all fits —” “No, it doesn’t,” she said. “It doesn’t, Harry, you’re just getting carried  away.  Please,”  she  said  as  he  started  to  speak,  “please  just answer  me  this:  If  the  Deathly  Hallows  really  existed,  and  Dum-bledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all three of them would be master of Death — Harry, why wouldn’t he have told you? Why?” He had his answer ready. “But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to find out about them for yourself! It’s a Quest!” “But  I  only  said  that  to  try  and  persuade  you  to  come  to  the Lovegoods’!”  cried  Hermione  in  exasperation.  “I  didn’t  really  be-lieve it!” Harry took no notice. “Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he’d do.” “Harry, this isn’t a game, this isn’t practice! This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the  Horcruxes!  That  symbol  doesn’t  mean  anything,  forget  the Deathly Hallows, we can’t afford to get sidetracked —” Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection  Stone,  to  prove  to  Hermione  that  he  was  right,  that the Deathly Hallows were real. She appealed to Ron. “You don’t believe in this, do you?” Harry looked up. Ron hesitated. (cid:145) 433 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO “I dunno . . . I mean . . . bits of it sort of fit together,” said Ron awkwardly. “But when you look at the whole thing . . .” He took a deep breath. “I think we’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That’s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe . . . maybe we should forget about this Hallows business.” “Thank you, Ron,” said Hermione. “I’ll take first watch.” And  she  strode  past  Harry  and  sat  down  in  the  tent  entrance, bringing the action to a fierce full stop. But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hal-lows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while agi-tating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all. . . . I open at the close. . . . But what was ‘the close’? Why couldn’t he have the stone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumble-dore these questions in person . . . and Harry murmured words to the  Snitch  in  the  darkness,  trying  everything,  even  Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open. . . . And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort’s thoughts, because for the first time ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing. . . . Hermione would not like that idea, of course. . . . But then, she did not believe . . . Xenophilius had been right, in a way . . . Limited. Narrow. Close-minded. The truth was that she was scared of the idea of  the  Deathly  Hallows,  especially  of  the  Resurrection  Stone  .  .  . and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly swallowing it, but the cold metal did not yield. . . . It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed (cid:145) 434 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contempla-tion of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her; but dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not yet tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand. . . . He must try that in the morning. . . . If only there was a way of getting a better wand . . . And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, in-vincible, swallowed him once more. . . . They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where  they  pitched  the  tent  that  night,  and  persisted  through  the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione’s flat disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful  it  made  him.  He  blamed  Ron  and  Hermione:  Their  deter-mined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his  spirits,  but  neither  could  erode  his  certainty,  which  remained absolute.  Harry’s  belief  in  and  longing  for  the  Hallows  consumed him so much that he felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes. “Obsession?”  said  Hermione  in  a  low  fierce  voice,  when  Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes. “We’re not the ones with an obsession, Harry! We’re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!” But  he  was  impervious  to  the  veiled  criticism.  Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he (cid:145) 435 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO had  also,  Harry  remained  convinced  of  it,  left  the  Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other survives. . . . master of Death . . . Why didn’t Ron and Hermione understand? “ ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’ ” Harry quoted calmly. “I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fight-ing?” Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her. Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shift-ing as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry con-nected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort’s mind as well as before. As  the  weeks  crept  on,  Harry  could  not  help  but  notice,  even through  his  new  self-absorption,  that  Ron  seemed  to  be  taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having   (cid:145) 436 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS walked out on them, perhaps because Harry’s descent into listless-ness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action. “Three Horcruxes left,” he kept saying. “We need a plan of ac-tion, come on! Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it again. The orphanage . . .” Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Volde-mort’s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted  on  journeying  to  ever  more  unlikely  places  simply,  Harry was aware, to keep them moving. “You never know,” was Ron’s constant refrain. “Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go and have a poke around.” These  frequent  forays  into  Wizarding  territory  brought  them within occasional sight of Snatchers. “Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,” said Ron. “The lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill reckons some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch —” “On what?” said Harry. “Potterwatch, didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called? The pro-gram I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what’s going on! Nearly all the programs are following You-Know-Who’s line, all except Potterwatch. I really want you to hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in. . . .”  (cid:145) 437 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out vari-ous rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occa-sionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragon pox, and once a few bars of “A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love.” While he tapped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct pass-word, muttering strings of random words under his breath. “They’re normally something to do with the Order,” he told them. “Bill had a real knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get one in the end. . . .” But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. “I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ‘Albus’! Get in here, Harry!” Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly  Hallows,  Harry  hurried  back  inside  the  tent  to  find  Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermi-one, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for some-thing to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing. “.  .  .  apologize  for  our  temporary  absence  from  the  airwaves, which  was  due  to  a  number  of  house  calls  in  our  area  by  those charming Death Eaters.” “But that’s Lee Jordan!” said Hermione. “I know!” beamed Ron. “Cool, eh?” “. . . now found ourselves another secure location,” Lee was say-ing,  “and  I’m  pleased  to  tell  you  that  two  of  our  regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!” “Hi.” (cid:145) 438 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS “Evening, River.” “ ‘River,’ that’s Lee,” Ron explained. “They’ve all got code names, but you can usually tell —” “Shh!” said Hermione. “But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,” Lee went on, “let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don’t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.” Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one another in horror. “A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that  Muggle-born  Dean  Thomas  and  a  second  goblin,  both  be-lieved  to  have  been  traveling  with  Tonks,  Cresswell,  and  Gor-nuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news. “Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing the deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse — more evidence, as if it were needed, of  the  fact  that  Muggle  slaughter  is  becoming  little  more  than  a recreational sport under the new regime. “Finally,  we  regret  to  inform  our  listeners  that  the  remains  of Bathilda  Bagshot  have  been  discovered  in  Godric’s  Hollow.  The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the Phoe-nix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic. “Listeners,  I’d  like  to  invite  you  now  to  join  us  in  a  minute’s (cid:145) 439 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.” Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time. “Thank you,” said Lee’s voice. “And now we turn to regular con-tributor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.” “Thanks,  River,”  said  an  unmistakable  voice,  deep,  measured, reassuring. “Kingsley!” burst out Ron. “We know!” said Hermione, hushing him. “Muggles  remain  ignorant  of  the  source  of  their  suffering  as they continue to sustain heavy casualties,” said Kingsley. “However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking  their  own  safety  to  protect  Muggle  friends  and  neighbors, often without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.” “And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be ‘Wizards first’?” asked Lee. “I’d say that it’s one short step from ‘Wizards first’ to ‘Purebloods first,’ and then to ‘Death Eaters,’ ” replied Kingsley. “We’re all hu-man,  aren’t  we?  Every  human  life  is  worth  the  same,  and  worth saving.” “Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of (cid:145) 440 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS Magic if ever we get out of this mess,” said Lee. “And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature ‘Pals of Potter.’ ” “Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice; Ron started to speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a whisper. “We know it’s Lupin!” “Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve ap-peared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?” “I do,” said Lupin firmly. “There is no doubt at all in my mind that  his  death  would  be  proclaimed  as  widely  as  possible  by  the Death Eaters if it  had happened,  because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. ‘The Boy Who Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the  triumph  of  good,  the  power  of  innocence,  the  need  to  keep resisting.” A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven  him,  then,  for  the  terrible  things  he  had  said  when  they had last met? “And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?” “I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Lupin, then hesi-tated  slightly.  “And  I’d  tell  him  to  follow  his  instincts,  which  are good and nearly always right.” Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. “Nearly always right,” she repeated. “Oh, didn’t I tell you?” said Ron in surprise. “Bill told me Lupin’s living  with  Tonks  again!  And  apparently  she’s  getting  pretty  big too. . . .” “. . . and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter’s who are suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying. (cid:145) 441 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO “Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspo-ken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, includ-ing Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,” said Lupin. “At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron. “We  have  also  heard  within  the  last  few  hours  that  Rubeus Hagrid” — all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of  the  sentence  —  “well-known  gamekeeper  at  Hogwarts  School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support Harry Potter’ party in his house.  However,  Hagrid  was  not  taken  into  custody,  and  is,  we believe, on the run.” “I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee. “It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against following Hagrid’s lead. ‘Support Harry Potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate.” “Indeed  they  are,  Romulus,”  said  Lee,  “so  we  suggest  that  you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new correspondent: Rodent.” “ ‘Rodent’?” said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried out together: “Fred!” (cid:145) 442 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS “No — is it George?” “It’s Fred, I think,” said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, “I’m  not  being  ‘Rodent,’  no  way,  I  told  you  I  wanted  to  be ‘Rapier’!” “Oh, all right then. ‘Rapier,’ could you please give us your take on  the  various  stories  we’ve  been  hearing  about  the  Chief  Death Eater?” “Yes, River, I can,” said Fred. “As our listeners will know, unless they’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who’s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.” “Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley. “The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.” “Agreed,” said Fred. “So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look into  its  eyes,  although  if  it  really  is  You-Know-Who,  that’s  still likely to be the last thing you ever do.” For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the weight of tension leaving him. “And  the  rumors  that  he  keeps  being  sighted  abroad?”  asked Lee. “Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he’s been putting in?” asked Fred. “Point is, people, don’t get (cid:145) 443 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he’s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don’t count on him being a long way away if you’re planning on taking any risks. I never thought I’d hear myself say it, but safety first!” “Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,” said Lee. “Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The next password will be ‘Mad-Eye.’ Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.” The radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had be-come so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people  were  resisting  Voldemort.  It  was  like  waking  from  a  long sleep. “Good, eh?” said Ron happily. “Brilliant,” said Harry. “It’s  so  brave  of  them,”  sighed  Hermione  admiringly.  “If  they were found . . .” “Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron. “Like us.” “But did you hear what Fred said?” asked Harry excitedly; now the  broadcast  was  over,  his  thoughts  turned  again  toward  his  all-consuming  obsession.  “He’s  abroad!  He’s  still  looking  for  the Wand, I knew it!” “Harry —” “Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol —” (cid:145) 444 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  DEATHLY  HALLOWS “HARRY, NO!” “— demort’s after the Elder Wand!” “The name’s Taboo!” Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent. “I told you, Harry, I told you, we can’t say it anymore — we’ve got to put the protection back around us — quickly — it’s how they find —” But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled the De-luminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out. “Come out of there with your hands up!” came a rasping voice through the darkness. “We know you’re in there! You’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don’t care who we curse!” (cid:145) 445 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E N T Y - T H R E E MALFOY MANOR     H arry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness. He saw Hermione point her wand, not toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang, a burst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel his  face  swelling  rapidly  under  his  hands  as  heavy  footfalls  sur-rounded him. “Get up, vermin.” Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground. Before he could stop them, someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry clutched at his excruci-atingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight,  swollen,  and  puffy  as  though  he  had  suffered  some  violent allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent; all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too. (cid:145) 446 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR “Get — off — her!” Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, “No! Leave him alone, leave him alone!” “Your boyfriend’s going to have worse than that done to him if he’s on my list,” said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. “Delicious girl . . . What a treat . . . I do enjoy the softness of the skin. . . .” Harry’s  stomach  turned  over.  He  knew  who  this  was:  Fenrir Greyback,  the  werewolf  who  was  permitted  to  wear  Death  Eater robes in return for his hired savagery. “Search the tent!” said another voice. Harry was thrown facedown onto the ground. A thud told him that Ron had been cast down beside him. They could hear foot-steps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched. “Now,  let’s  see  who  we’ve  got,”  said  Greyback’s  gloating  voice from overhead, and Harry was rolled over onto his back. A beam of wandlight fell into his face and Greyback laughed. “I’ll  be  needing  butterbeer  to  wash  this  one  down.  What  hap-pened to you, ugly?” Harry did not answer immediately. “I  said,”  repeated  Greyback,  and  Harry  received  a  blow  to  the diaphragm that made him double over in pain, “what happened to you?” “Stung,” Harry muttered. “Been stung.” “Yeah, looks like it,” said a second voice. “What’s your name?” snarled Greyback. “Dudley,” said Harry. “And your first name?” “I — Vernon. Vernon Dudley.” (cid:145) 447 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE “Check the list, Scabior,” said Greyback, and Harry heard him move sideways to look down at Ron, instead. “And what about you, ginger?” “Stan Shunpike,” said Ron. “Like ’ell you are,” said the man called Scabior. “We know Stan Shunpike, ’e’s put a bit of work our way.” There was another thud. “I’b Bardy,” said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. “Bardy Weadley.” “A Weasley?” rasped Greyback. “So you’re related to blood trai-tors  even  if  you’re  not  a  Mudblood.  And  lastly,  your  pretty  little friend . . .” The relish in his voice made Harry’s flesh crawl. “Easy, Greyback,” said Scabior over the jeering of the others. “Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet. We’ll see if she’s a bit quicker at remembering her name than Barny. Who are you, girly?” “Penelope  Clearwater,”  said  Hermione.  She  sounded  terrified, but convincing. “What’s your blood status?” “Half-blood,” said Hermione. “Easy enough to check,” said Scabior. “But the ’ole lot of ’em look like they could still be ’ogwarts age —” “We’b lebt,” said Ron. “Left,  ’ave  you,  ginger?”  said  Scabior.  “And  you  decided  to  go camping?  And  you  thought,  just  for  a  laugh,  you’d  use  the  Dark Lord’s name?” “Nod a laugh,” said Ron. “Aggiden.” “Accident?” There was more jeering laughter. “You know who used to like using the Dark Lord’s name,   (cid:145) 448 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR Weasley?”  growled  Greyback.  “The  Order  of  the  Phoenix.  Mean anything to you?” “Doh.” “Well,  they  don’t  show  the  Dark  Lord  proper  respect,  so  the name’s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. We’ll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!” Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed him down into a sitting position, then started binding him back-to-back  with  other  people.  Harry  was  still  half  blind,  barely able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When at last the man  tying  them  had  walked  away,  Harry  whispered  to  the  other prisoners. “Anyone still got a wand?” “No,” said Ron and Hermione from either side of him. “This is all my fault. I said the name, I’m sorry —” “Harry?” It was a new, but familiar, voice, and it came from directly behind Harry, from the person tied to Hermione’s left. “Dean?” “It is you! If they find out who they’ve got — ! They’re Snatchers, they’re only looking for truants to sell for gold —” “Not a bad little haul for one night,” Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent. “A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and three truants. You checked their names on the list yet, Scabior?” he roared. “Yeah. There’s no Vernon Dudley on ’ere, Greyback.” “Interesting,” said Greyback. “That’s interesting.”  (cid:145) 449 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infini-tesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids, a face covered in mat-ted gray hair and whiskers, with pointed brown teeth and sores at the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood. “So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list un-der a different name? What House were you in at Hogwarts?” “Slytherin,” said Harry automatically. “Funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that,” jeered Scabior out of the shadows. “But none of ’em can tell us where the com-mon room is.” “It’s in the dungeons,” said Harry clearly. “You enter through the wall. It’s full of skulls and stuff and it’s under the lake, so the light’s all green.” There was a short pause. “Well, well, looks like we really ’ave caught a little Slytherin,” said Scabior. “Good for you, Vernon, ’cause there ain’t a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who’s your father?” “He works at the Ministry,” Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the  game  was  up  in  any  case.  “Department  of  Magical  Accidents and Catastrophes.” “You  know  what,  Greyback,”  said  Scabior.  “I  think  there  is  a Dudley in there.” Harry  could  barely  breathe:  Could  luck,  sheer  luck,  get  them safely out of this?  (cid:145) 450 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR “Well,  well,”  said  Greyback,  and  Harry  could  hear  the  tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry official. Harry’s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it. “If you’re telling the truth, ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect your father’ll reward us just for picking you up.” “But,” said Harry, his mouth bone dry, “if you just let us —” “Hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “Look at this, Grey-back!” A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver in the light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor’s sword. “Ve-e-ry  nice,”  said  Greyback  appreciatively,  taking  it  from  his companion. “Oh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?” “It’s my father’s,” Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. “We borrowed it to cut firewood —” “ ’ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!” As Scabior said it, Harry’s scar, which was stretched tight across his distended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress,  jet-black  and  forbidding;  Voldemort’s  thoughts  had  sud-denly become razor-sharp again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose. . . . So close . . . So close . . .  (cid:145) 451 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort’s thoughts, pulling himself back to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermi-one,  Dean,  and  Griphook  in  the  darkness,  listening  to  Greyback and Scabior. “ ‘’ermione Granger,’ ” Scabior was saying, “ ‘the Mudblood who is known to be traveling with ’arry Potter.’ ” Harry’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme ef-fort to keep himself present, not to slip into Voldemort’s mind. He heard the creak of Greyback’s boots as he crouched down in front of Hermione. “You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you.” back quietly. “It isn’t! It isn’t me!” Hermione’s terrified squeak was as good as a confession. “ ‘. . . known to be traveling with Harry Potter,’ ” repeated Grey-A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry’s scar was exquisitely painful,  but  he  struggled  with  all  his  strength  against  the  pull  of Voldemort’s thoughts: It had never been so important to remain in his own right mind. “Well, this changes things, doesn’t it?” whispered Greyback. No-body spoke: Harry sensed the gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione’s arm trembling against his. Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features. “What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” he asked softly, his breath foul in Harry’s nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar. “Don’t  touch  it!”  Harry  yelled;  he  could  not  stop  himself;  he thought he might be sick from the pain of it. (cid:145) 452 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR “I thought you wore glasses, Potter?” breathed Greyback. “I  found  glasses!”  yelped  one  of  the  Snatchers  skulking  in  the background. “There was glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait —” And seconds later Harry’s glasses had been rammed back onto his face. The Snatchers were closing in now, peering at him. “It is!” rasped Greyback. “We’ve caught Potter!” They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. Harry, still fighting to remain present inside his own split-ting head, could think of nothing to say: Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind — — He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress — No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger — — looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower — He  was  Harry,  and  they  were  discussing  his  fate  in  low voices — —  Time to fly . . . “. . . to the Ministry?” “To  hell  with  the  Ministry,”  growled  Greyback.  “They’ll  take the credit, and we won’t get a look in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who.” “Will  you  summon  ’im?  ’ere?”  said  Scabior,  sounding  awed, terrified. “No,” snarled Greyback, “I haven’t got — they say he’s using the Malfoys’ place as a base. We’ll take the boy there.” Harry  thought  he  knew  why  Greyback  was  not  calling  Volde-mort.  The  werewolf  might  be  allowed  to  wear  Death  Eater  robes when  they  wanted  to  use  him,  but  only  Voldemort’s  inner  circle were branded with the Dark Mark: Greyback had not been granted this highest honor. (cid:145) 453 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE Harry’s scar seared again — — and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the window at the very top of the tower — “. . . completely sure it’s him? ’Cause if it ain’t, Greyback, we’re dead.” “Who’s in charge here?” roared Greyback, covering his moment of inadequacy. “I say that’s Potter, and him plus his wand, that’s two hundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you’re too gutless to come along, any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, I’ll get the girl thrown in!” — The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough for  a  man  to  enter.  .  .  .  A  skeletal  figure  was  just  visible  through  it, curled beneath a blanket. . . . Dead, or sleeping . . . ? “All right!” said Scabior. “All right, we’re in! And what about the rest of ’em, Greyback, what’ll we do with ’em?” “Might  as  well  take  the  lot.  We’ve  got  two  Mudbloods,  that’s another ten Galleons. Give me the sword as well. If they’re rubies, that’s another small fortune right there.” The prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Her-mione’s breathing, fast and terrified. “Grab hold and make it tight. I’ll do Potter!” said Greyback, seiz-ing a fistful of Harry’s hair; Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. “On three! One — two — three —” They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry strug-gled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand, but it was hopeless: Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side, he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still —  (cid:145) 454 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR — as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor, inside the cell-like room — The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a coun-try lane. Harry’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had not happened yet: Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew, for he was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. How long it would take Voldemort to get  to  this  place,  once  he  knew  that  Harry  was  here,  was  another matter. . . . One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them. “How  do  we  get  in?  They’re  locked,  Greyback,  I  can’t  — blimey!” He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting, twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frighten-ing  face,  which  spoke  in  a  clanging,  echoing  voice:  “State  your purpose!” “We’ve got Potter!” Greyback roared triumphantly. “We’ve cap-tured Harry Potter!” The gates swung open. “Come  on!”  said  Greyback  to  his  men,  and  the  prisoners  were shunted through the gates and up the drive, between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and was dragged  onto  his  feet  by  Greyback;  now  he  was  staggering  along sideways, tied back-to-back to the four other prisoners. Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a   (cid:145) 455 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he knew yet that Harry was caught. . . . The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, eyes opening in a skull of a face. . . . The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon him, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. . . . “So,  you  have  come.  I  thought  you  would  .  .  .  one  day.  But  your journey was pointless. I never had it.” “You lie!” As Voldemort’s anger throbbed inside him, Harry’s scar threat-ened  to  burst  with  pain,  and  he  wrenched  his  mind  back  to  his own body, fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel. Light spilled out over all of them. “What is this?” said a woman’s cold voice. “We’re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” rasped Grey-back. “Who are you?” “You know me!” There was resentment in the werewolf’s voice. “Fenrir Greyback! We’ve caught Harry Potter!” Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too. “I know ’e’s swollen, ma’am, but it’s ’im!” piped up Scabior. “If you look a bit closer, you’ll see ’is scar. And this ’ere, see the girl? The Mudblood who’s been traveling around with ’im, ma’am. There’s no doubt it’s ’im, and we’ve got ’is wand as well! ’Ere, ma’am —” Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutiniz-ing his swollen face. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows. (cid:145) 456 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR “Bring them in,” she said. Harry  and  the  others  were  shoved  and  kicked  up  broad  stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits. “Follow me,” said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. “My son, Draco, is home for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.” The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more por-traits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers. “What is this?” The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry’s ears. He was panicking now: He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out Voldemort’s thoughts, though his scar was still burning. “They say they’ve got Potter,” said Narcissa’s cold voice. “Draco, come here.” Harry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely: a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair. Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath the chandelier. “Well, boy?” rasped the werewolf. Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw  his  own  reflection  for  the  first  time  since  leaving  Grimmauld Place. (cid:145) 457 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE His  face  was  huge,  shiny,  and  pink,  every  feature  distorted  by Hermione’s  jinx.  His  black  hair  reached  his  shoulders  and  there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was he  who  stood  there,  he  would  have  wondered  who  was  wearing his glasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached. “Well, Draco?” said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. “Is it? Is it Harry Potter?” “I can’t — I can’t be sure,” said Draco. He was keeping his dis-tance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him. “But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!” Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited. “Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv —” “Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy?” said Greyback menacingly. “Of course not, of course not!” said Lucius impatiently. He ap-proached  Harry  himself,  came  so  close  that  Harry  could  see  the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peer-ing out from between the bars of a cage. “What did you do to him?” Lucius asked Greyback. “How did he get into this state?” “That wasn’t us.” “Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” said Lucius. His gray eyes raked Harry’s forehead. “There’s something there,” he whispered, “it could be the scar, (cid:145) 458 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR stretched tight. . . . Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?” Harry  saw  Draco’s  face  up  close  now,  right  beside  his  father’s. They were extraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside  himself  with  excitement,  Draco’s  expression  was  full  of  re-luctance, even fear. “I don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching. “We had better be certain, Lucius,” Narcissa called to her hus-band  in  her  cold,  clear  voice.  “Completely  sure  that  it  is  Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord . . . They say this is his” — she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand — “but it does not re-semble Ollivander’s description. . . . If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing . . . Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?” “What  about  the  Mudblood,  then?”  growled  Greyback.  Harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light fell on Hermione instead. “Wait,”  said  Narcissa  sharply.  “Yes  —  yes,  she  was  in  Madam Malkin’s with Potter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isn’t it the Granger girl?” “I . . . maybe . . . yeah.” “But  then,  that’s  the  Weasley  boy!”  shouted  Lucius,  strid-ing  around  the  bound  prisoners  to  face  Ron.  “It’s  them,  Potter’s friends — Draco, look at him, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s his name — ?” “Yeah,”  said  Draco  again,  his  back  to  the  prisoners.  “It  could be.” The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, (cid:145) 459 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE and the sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch. “What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?” Bellatrix  Lestrange  walked  slowly  around  the  prisoners,  and stopped on Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes. “But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?” “Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think, Potter! Potter and his friends, caught at last!” “Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take  in  Harry.  “Are  you  sure?  Well  then,  the  Dark  Lord  must  be informed at once!” She  dragged  back  her  left  sleeve:  Harry  saw  the  Dark  Mark burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her beloved master — “I  was  about  to  call  him!”  said  Lucius,  and  his  hand  actually closed  upon  Bellatrix’s  wrist,  preventing  her  from  touching  the Mark. “I shall summon him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my authority —” “Your  authority!”  she  sneered,  attempting  to  wrench  her  hand from his grasp. “You lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!” “This  is  nothing  to  do  with  you,  you  did  not  capture  the boy —” “Begging  your  pardon,  Mr.  Malfoy,”  interjected  Greyback, “but  it’s  us  that  caught  Potter,  and  it’s  us  that’ll  be  claiming  the gold —” “Gold!”  laughed  Bellatrix,  still  attempting  to  throw  off  her (cid:145) 460 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR brother-in-law, her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand. “Take your gold, filthy scavenger, what do I want with gold? I seek only the honor of his — of —” She  stopped  struggling,  her  dark  eyes  fixed  upon  something Harry could not see. Jubilant at her capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve — “STOP!” shrieked Bellatrix. “Do not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now!” Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bel-latrix strode out of Harry’s limited line of vision. “What is that?” he heard her say. “Sword,” grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher. “Give it to me.” “It’s not yorn, missus, it’s mine, I reckon I found it.” There was a bang and a flash of red light: Harry knew that the Snatcher had been Stunned. There was a roar of anger from his fel-lows: Scabior drew his wand. “What d’you think you’re playing at, woman?” “Stupefy!” she screamed. “Stupefy!” They were no match for her, even though there were four of them against  one  of  her:  She  was  a  witch,  as  Harry  knew,  with  prodi-gious skill and no conscience. They fell where they stood, all except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms outstretched.  Out  of  the  corners  of  his  eyes  Harry  saw  Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen. “Where did you get this sword?” she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip. “How dare you?” he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could (cid:145) 461 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE move as he was forced to gaze up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. “Release me, woman!” “Where did you find this sword?” she repeated, brandishing it in his face. “Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!” “It was in their tent,” rasped Greyback. “Release me, I say!” She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but ap-peared too wary to approach her. He prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved nails clutching its back. “Draco,  move  this  scum  outside,”  said  Bellatrix,  indicating  the unconscious men. “If you haven’t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.” “Don’t you dare speak to Draco like —” said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix screamed, “Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious problem!” She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examin-ing its hilt. Then she turned to look at the silent prisoners. “If  it  is  indeed  Potter,  he  must  not  be  harmed,”  she  muttered, more to herself than to the others. “The Dark Lord wishes to dis-pose of Potter himself. . . . But if he finds out . . . I must . . . I must know. . . .” She turned back to her sister again. “The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do!” “This is my house, Bella, you don’t give orders in my —” “Do it! You have no idea of the danger we are in!” shrieked Bel-latrix. She looked frightening, mad; a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet. Narcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf. (cid:145) 462 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR “Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.” “Wait,”  said  Bellatrix  sharply.  “All  except  .  .  .  except  for  the Mudblood.” Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure. “No!” shouted Ron. “You can have me, keep me!” Bellatrix  hit  him  across  the  face;  the  blow  echoed  around  the room. “If she dies under questioning, I’ll take you next,” she said. “Blood traitor  is  next  to  Mudblood  in  my  book.  Take  them  downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more to them — yet.” She threw Greyback’s wand back to him, then took a short silver knife from under her robes. She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door,  into  a  dark  passageway,  his  wand  held  out  in  front  of  him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force. “Reckon she’ll let me have a bit of the girl when she’s finished with her?” Greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor. “I’d say I’ll get a bite or two, wouldn’t you, ginger?” Harry  could  feel  Ron  shaking.  They  were  forced  down  a  steep flight of stairs, still tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and breaking  their  necks  at  any  moment.  At  the  bottom  was  a  heavy door.  Greyback  unlocked  it  with  a  tap  of  his  wand,  then  forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness. The  echoing  bang  of  the  slammed  cellar  door  had  not  died  away before  there  was  a  terrible,  drawn-out  scream  from  directly  above them. “HERMIONE!”  Ron  bellowed,  and  he  started  to  writhe  and (cid:145) 463 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE struggle against the ropes tying them together, so that Harry stag-gered. “HERMIONE!” “Be quiet!” Harry said. “Shut up, Ron, we need to work out a “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!” “We need a plan, stop yelling — we need to get these ropes “Harry?”  came  a  whisper  through  the  darkness.  “Ron?  Is  that way —” off —” you?” Ron stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry saw a shadow moving closer. “Harry? Ron?” “Luna?” “Yes, it’s me! Oh no, I didn’t want you to be caught!” “Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?” said Harry. “Oh yes, I expect so. . . . There’s an old nail we use if we need to break anything. . . . Just a moment . . .” Hermione  screamed  again  from  overhead,  and  they  could  hear Bellatrix  screaming  too,  but  her  words  were  inaudible,  for  Ron shouted again, “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!” “Mr.  Ollivander?”  Harry  could  hear  Luna  saying.  “Mr.  Olli-vander, have you got the nail? If you just move over a little bit. . . I think it was beside the water jug. . . .” She was back within seconds. “You’ll need to stay still,” she said. Harry could feel her digging at the rope’s tough fibers to work the knots free. From upstairs they heard Bellatrix’s voice. “I’m  going  to  ask  you  again!  Where  did  you  get  this  sword? Where?” (cid:145) 464 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR “We found it — we found it — PLEASE!” Hermione screamed again;  Ron  struggled  harder  than  ever,  and  the  rusty  nail  slipped onto Harry’s wrist. “Ron,  please  stay  still!”  Luna  whispered.  “I  can’t  see  what  I’m doing —” “My  pocket!”  said  Ron.  “In  my  pocket,  there’s  a  Deluminator, and it’s full of light!” A few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the Deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar: Unable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung there, like  tiny  suns,  flooding  the  underground  room  with  light.  Harry saw  Luna,  all  eyes  in  her  white  face,  and  the  motionless  figure  of Ollivander  the  wandmaker,  curled  up  on  the  floor  in  the  corner. Craning around, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners: Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans. “Oh, that’s much easier, thanks, Ron,” said Luna, and she began hacking at their bindings again. “Hello, Dean!” From above came Bellatrix’s voice. “You are lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth!” Another terrible scream — “HERMIONE!” “What else did you take? What else have you got? Tell me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!” “There!” Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see  Ron  running  around  the  cellar,  looking  up  at  the  low  ceiling, searching  for  a  trapdoor.  Dean,  his  face  bruised  and  bloody,  said (cid:145) 465 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE “Thanks”  to  Luna  and  stood  there,  shivering,  but  Griphook  sank onto  the  cellar  floor,  looking  groggy  and  disoriented,  many  welts across his swarthy face. Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand. “There’s no way out, Ron,” said Luna, watching his fruitless ef-forts. “The cellar is completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ol-livander has been here for a long time, he’s tried everything.” Hermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry like  physical  pain.  Barely  conscious  of  the  fierce  prickling  of  his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless. “What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!” Hermione’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrid’s pouch from around his neck and groped inside it: He pulled out Dumbledore’s Snitch and shook it, hoping for he did not know what — nothing happened — he waved the broken  halves  of  the  phoenix  wand,  but  they  were  lifeless  —  the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of brightest blue — Dumbledore’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. “Help us!” he yelled at it in mad desperation. “We’re in the cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us!” The eye blinked and was gone. Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs Hermione was screaming  worse  than  ever,  and  next  to  him  Ron  was  bellowing, “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!” (cid:145) 466 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR “How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix scream. “Did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?” “We  only  met  him  tonight!”  Hermione  sobbed.  “We’ve  never been inside your vault. . . . It isn’t the real sword! It’s a copy, just a copy! “A copy?” screeched Bellatrix. “Oh, a likely story!” “But we can find out easily!” came Lucius’s voice. “Draco, fetch the goblin, he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!” Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor. “Griphook,” he whispered into the goblin’s pointed ear, “you must tell them that sword’s a fake, they mustn’t know it’s the real one, Griphook, please —” He could hear someone scuttling down the cellar steps; next mo-ment, Draco’s shaking voice spoke from behind the door. “Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don’t try anything, or I’ll kill you!” They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar’s darkness. The door flew open; Malfoy marched inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar. Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst. “DOB — !” Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked (cid:145) 467 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE terrified at his mistake. Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix. Dobby’s  enormous,  tennis-ball-shaped  eyes  were  wide;  he  was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petrified. “Harry  Potter,”  he  squeaked  in  the  tiniest  quiver  of  a  voice, “Dobby has come to rescue you.” “But how did you — ?” An  awful  scream  drowned  Harry’s  words:  Hermione  was  being tortured again. He cut to the essentials. “You can Disapparate out of this cellar?” he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears flapping. “And you can take humans with you?” Dobby nodded again. “Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Olli-vander, and take them — take them to —” “Bill  and  Fleur’s,”  said  Ron.  “Shell  Cottage  on  the  outskirts  of Tinworth!” The elf nodded for a third time. “And then come back,” said Harry. “Can you do that, Dobby?” “Of  course,  Harry  Potter,”  whispered  the  little  elf.  He  hurried over  to  Mr.  Ollivander,  who  appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the wandmaker’s hands in his own, then held out the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved. “Harry, we want to help you!” Luna whispered. “We can’t leave you here,” said Dean. “Go, both of you! We’ll see you at Bill and Fleur’s.” As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few   (cid:145) 468 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR seconds he looked down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully. “Kill  me,  then,  Voldemort,  I  welcome  death!  But  my  death  will not bring you what you seek. . . . There is so much you do not under-stand. . . .” He felt Voldemort’s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out, returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present. “Go!” Harry beseeched Luna and Dean. “Go! We’ll follow, just go!” They  caught  hold  of  the  elf’s  outstretched  fingers.  There  was another  loud  crack,  and  Dobby,  Luna,  Dean,  and  Ollivander vanished. “What was that?” shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. “Did you hear that? What was that noise in the cellar?” Harry and Ron stared at each other. “Draco — no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!” Footsteps  crossed  the  room  overhead,  then  there  was  silence. Harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar. “We’re going to have to try and tackle him,” he whispered to Ron. They had no choice: The moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. “Leave the lights on,” Harry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps out-side the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it. “Stand back,” came Wormtail’s voice. “Stand away from the door. I am coming in.” The door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three miniature   (cid:145) 469 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE suns floating in midair. Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon him. Ron seized Wormtail’s wand arm and forced it upward; Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling his voice. Silently they struggled:  Wormtail’s  wand  emitted  sparks;  his  silver  hand  closed around Harry’s throat. “What is it, Wormtail?” called Lucius Malfoy from above. “Nothing!” Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail’s wheezy voice. “All fine!” Harry could barely breathe. “You’re going to kill me?” Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. “After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!” The  silver  fingers  slackened.  Harry  had  not  expected  it:  He wrenched  himself  free,  astonished,  keeping  his  hand  over  Worm-tail’s mouth. He saw the ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness. “And we’ll have that,” whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail’s wand from his other hand. Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew’s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid from Harry’s face to something else. His own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat. “No —” Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and use-less owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes. (cid:145) 470 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR “No!” Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail’s throat, but it was no use. Pettigrew was turning blue. “Relashio!”  said  Ron,  pointing  the  wand  at  the  silver  hand,  but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. Worm-tail’s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and was still. Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail’s body on the floor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shad-owy passageway leading to the drawing room. Cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, which was ajar. Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who was holding Gryffindor’s sword in his long-fingered hands. Her-mione was lying at Bellatrix’s feet. She was barely stirring. “Well?” Bellatrix said to Griphook. “Is it the true sword?” Harry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar. “No,” said Griphook. “It is a fake.” “Are you sure?” panted Bellatrix. “Quite sure?” “Yes,” said the goblin. Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it. “Good,” she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblin’s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him aside. “And now,” she said in a voice that burst with triumph, “we call the Dark Lord!” And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark Mark. (cid:145) 471 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE At once, Harry’s scar felt as though it had split open again. His true  surroundings  vanished:  He  was  Voldemort,  and  the  skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he felt — he had warned them, he had told them to  summon  him  for  nothing  less  than  Potter.  If  they  were  mis-taken . . . “Kill  me,  then!”  demanded  the  old  man.  “You  will  not  win,  you cannot win! That wand will never, ever be yours —” And  Voldemort’s  fury  broke:  A  burst  of  green  light  filled  the prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort returned to the window, his wrath barely controllable. . . . They would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back. . . . “And I think,” said Bellatrix’s voice, “we can dispose of the Mud-blood. Greyback, take her if you want her.” “NOOOOOOOOOOOO!” Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around, shocked; she turned her wand to face Ron instead — “Expelliarmus!”  he  roared,  pointing  Wormtail’s  wand  at  Bella-trix, and hers flew into the air and was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, Draco, and Greyback wheeled about;  Harry  yelled,  “Stupefy!”  and  Lucius  Malfoy  collapsed  onto the  hearth.  Jets  of  light  flew  from  Draco’s,  Narcissa’s,  and  Grey-back’s  wands;  Harry  threw  himself  to  the  floor,  rolling  behind  a sofa to avoid them. “STOP OR SHE DIES!” Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was supporting  Hermione,  who  seemed  to  be  unconscious,  and  was holding her short silver knife to Hermione’s throat. (cid:145) 472 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR “Drop your wands,” she whispered. “Drop them, or we’ll see ex-actly how filthy her blood is!” Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtail’s wand. Harry straightened up, still holding Bellatrix’s. “I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermi-one’s throat: Harry saw beads of blood appear there. “All right!” he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix’s wand onto the floor at his feet. Ron did the same with Wormtail’s. Both raised their hands to shoulder height. “Good!”  she  leered.  “Draco,  pick  them  up!  The  Dark  Lord  is coming, Harry Potter! Your death approaches!” Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel Voldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out. “Now,” said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands, “Cissy, I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.” At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All  of  them  looked  upward  in  time  to  see  the  crystal  chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw herself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the  goblin,  who  still  clutched  the  sword  of  Gryffindor.  Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions: Draco doubled over, his hands covering his bloody face. (cid:145) 473 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took his chance: He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco’s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefy!” The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground. As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bel-latrix sprang to her feet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway. “Dobby!”  she  screamed,  and  even  Bellatrix  froze.  “You!  You dropped the chandelier — ?” The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. “You must not hurt Harry Potter,” he squeaked. “Kill him, Cissy!” shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and Narcissa’s wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. “You dirty little monkey!” bawled Bellatrix. “How dare you take a witch’s wand, how dare you defy your masters?” “Dobby has no master!” squealed the elf. “Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!” Harry’s  scar  was  blinding  him  with  pain.  Dimly  he  knew  that they had moments, seconds before Voldemort was with them. “Ron, catch — and GO!” he yelled, throwing one of the wands to  him;  then  he  bent  down  to  tug  Griphook  out  from  under  the chandelier.  Hoisting  the  groaning  goblin,  who  still  clung  to  the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby’s hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate. As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak (cid:145) 474 (cid:145) \\x0cMALFOY  MANOR of red that was Ron’s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix’s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing — Bill and Fleur’s . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur’s . . . He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was re-peat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to  take  him  there.  The  pain  in  his forehead pierced him, and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of Gryffindor’s sword bumping against his back; Dobby’s hand jerked in  his;  he  wondered  whether  the  elf  was  trying  to  take  charge,  to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with him. . . . And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to  his  knees,  relinquished  Dobby’s  hand,  and  attempted  to  lower Griphook gently to the ground. “Are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. Harry  squinted  around  through  the  darkness.  There  seemed  to be  a  cottage  a  short  way  away  under  the  wide  starry  sky,  and  he thought he saw movement outside it. “Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?” he whispered, clutching the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys’, ready to fight if he needed to. “Have we come to the right place? Dobby?” He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. “DOBBY!” The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf’s heaving chest. “Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry  bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. “HELP!” (cid:145) 475 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass. “Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die —” The elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. “Harry . . . Potter . . .” And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see. (cid:145) 476 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E N T Y - F O U R THE WANDMAKER     I t was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore’s body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix’s silver knife. Harry’s voice was still saying, “Dobby . . . Dobby . . .” even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back. After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gath-ering around him as he knelt over the elf. “Hermione?” he said suddenly. “Where is she?” “Ron’s taken her inside,” said Bill. “She’ll be all right.” Harry looked back down at Dobby. He stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf’s body, then dragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket. The sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; Harry lis-tened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which he (cid:145) 477 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR could take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making  suggestions  about  burying  the  elf.  Harry  agreed  without really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor. His  rage  was  dreadful  and  yet  Harry’s  grief  for  Dobby  seemed  to diminish  it,  so  that  it  became  a  distant  storm  that  reached  Harry from across a vast, silent ocean. “I want to do it properly,” were the first words of which Harry was  fully  conscious  of  speaking.  “Not  by  magic.  Have  you  got  a spade?” And  shortly  afterward  he  had  set  to  work,  alone,  digging  the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives. His scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was apart  from  it.  He  had  learned  control  at  last,  learned  to  shut  his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to pos-sess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out . . . though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. . . . On  Harry  dug,  deeper  and  deeper  into  the  hard,  cold  earth, subsuming  his  grief  in  sweat,  denying  the  pain  in  his  scar.  In  the darkness,  with  nothing  but  the  sound  of  his  own  breath  and  the (cid:145) 478 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys’ returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness. . . . The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hal-lows . . . Horcruxes . . . Hallows . . . Horcruxes . . . Yet he no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out: He felt as though he had been slapped awake again. Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the top-most cell of Nurmengard, and why. . . . And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small uncon-scious impulse of mercy. . . . Dumbledore had foreseen that. . . . How much more had he known? Harry  lost  track  of  time.  He  knew  only  that  the  darkness  had lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean. “How’s Hermione?” “Better,” said Ron. “Fleur’s looking after her.” Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not  simply  created  a  perfect  grave  with  his  wand,  but  he  did  not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of  their  own,  and  together  they  worked  in  silence  until  the  hole seemed deep enough. Harry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge  of  the  grave  and  stripped  off  his  shoes  and  socks,  which  he placed upon the elf’s bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry  placed  carefully  upon  Dobby’s  head,  muffling  his  batlike ears. “We should close his eyes.” Harry  had  not  heard  the  others  coming  through  the  darkness. (cid:145) 479 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to  be  Skele-Gro.  Hermione  was  wrapped  in  a  borrowed  dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when  she  reached  him.  Luna,  who  was  huddled  in  one  of  Fleur’s coats, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf’s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare. “There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.” Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. “I  think  we  ought  to  say  something,”  piped  up  Luna.  “I’ll  go first, shall I?” And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. “Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.” She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, “Yeah . . . thanks, Dobby.” “Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. “Good-bye,  Dobby,”  he  said.  It  was  all  he  could  manage,  but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of (cid:145) 480 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. “D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” he asked the others. They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up  one  of  the  largest  and  laid  it,  pillowlike,  over  the  place  where Dobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remem-ber wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. Slowly,  under  his  murmured  instruction,  deep  cuts  appeared upon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:  HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.  He looked down at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked  away,  his  scar  still  prickling  a  little,  and  his  mind  full  of those things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room (cid:145) 481 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR was  light-colored,  pretty,  with  a  small  fire  of  driftwood  burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening. “. . . lucky that Ginny’s on holiday. If she’d been at Hogwarts, they  could  have  taken  her  before  we  reached  her.  Now  we  know she’s safe too.” He looked around and saw Harry standing there. “I’ve  been  getting  them  all  out  of  the  Burrow,”  he  explained. “Moved them to Muriel’s. The Death Eaters know Ron’s with you now,  they’re  bound  to  target  the  family  —  don’t  apologize,”  he added at the sight of Harry’s expression. “It was always a matter of time, Dad’s been saying so for months. We’re the biggest blood-traitor family there is.” “How are they protected?” asked Harry. “Fidelius Charm. Dad’s Secret-Keeper. And we’ve done it on this cottage too; I’m Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that’s hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we’ll move them to Muriel’s too. There isn’t much room here, but she’s got plenty. Griphook’s legs are on the  mend,  Fleur’s  given  him  Skele-Gro;  we  could  probably  move them in an hour or —” “No,” Harry said, and Bill looked startled. “I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It’s important.” He heard the authority in his own voice, the conviction, the sense of purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobby’s grave. All of their faces were turned toward him, looking puzzled. “I’m going to wash,” Harry told Bill, looking down at his hands, still covered in mud and Dobby’s blood. “Then I’ll need to see them, straightaway.” (cid:145) 482 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER He walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark garden. . . . Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come. Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it. Harry  dried  his  hands,  impervious  to  the  beauty  of  the  scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sit-ting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all. And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was get-ting there too. Harry understood and yet did not understand. His instinct  was  telling  him  one  thing,  his  brain  quite  another.  The Dumbledore in Harry’s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers, pressed together as if in prayer. You gave Ron the Deluminator. You understood him. . . . You gave him a way back. . . . And you understood Wormtail too. . . . You knew there was a bit of regret there, somewhere. . . . And if you knew them . . . What did you know about me, Dumble-dore? Am I meant to know, but not to seek? Did you know how hard I’d find that? Is that why you made it this difficult? So I’d have time to work that out? Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold rim of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily surprised to (cid:145) 483 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and there flashed across his mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building he knew extremely well. Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs. “I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,” Harry said. “No,” said Fleur. “You will ’ave to wait, ’Arry. Zey are both ill, tired —” “I’m sorry,” he said without heat, “but it can’t wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately — and separately. It’s urgent.” “Harry, what the hell’s going on?” asked Bill. “You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as  though  she’s  been  tortured,  and  Ron’s  just  refused  to  tell  me anything —” “We can’t tell you what we’re doing,” said Harry flatly. “You’re in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We’re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.” Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at Harry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally Bill said, “All right. Who do you want to talk to first?” Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows? “Griphook,” Harry said. “I’ll speak to Griphook first.” His  heart  was  racing  as  if  he  had  been  sprinting  and  had  just cleared an enormous obstacle. “Up here, then,” said Bill, leading the way. Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back. (cid:145) 484 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER “I need you two as well!” he called to Ron and Hermione, who had  been  skulking,  half  concealed,  in  the  doorway  of  the  sitting room. They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved. “How are you?” Harry asked Hermione. “You were amazing — coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that —” Hermione  gave  a  weak  smile  as  Ron  gave  her  a  one-armed squeeze. “What are we doing now, Harry?” he asked. “You’ll see. Come on.” Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. Three doors led off it. “In here,” said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur’s room. It too had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry  moved  to  the  window,  turned  his  back  on  the  spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm. Bill  reappeared,  carrying  the  little  goblin,  whom  he  set  down carefully  upon  the  bed.  Griphook  grunted  thanks,  and  Bill  left, closing the door upon them all. “I’m sorry to take you out of bed,” said Harry. “How are your legs?” “Painful,” replied the goblin. “But mending.” He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look: half truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin’s sallow skin,  his  long  thin  fingers,  his  black  eyes.  Fleur  had  removed  his shoes: His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but not by much. His domed head was much bigger than a human’s. “You probably don’t remember —” Harry began. (cid:145) 485 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR “— that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time  you  ever  visited  Gringotts?”  said  Griphook.  “I  remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very famous.” Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up. Harry’s scar was still prickling. He wanted to get through this in-terview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request, the goblin broke the silence. “You buried the elf,” he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous. “I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.” “Yes,” said Harry. Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes. “You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.” “In what way?” asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently. “You dug the grave.” “So?” Griphook  did  not  answer.  Harry  rather  thought  he  was  being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby’s grave or not. He gath-ered himself for the attack. “Griphook, I need to ask —” “You also rescued a goblin.” “What?” “You brought me here. Saved me.” “Well, I take it you’re not sorry?” said Harry a little impatiently. “No,  Harry  Potter,”  said  Griphook,  and  with  one  finger  he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very odd wizard.” (cid:145) 486 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER “Right,” said Harry. “Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.” The  goblin  made  no  sign  of  encouragement,  but  continued  to frown at Harry as though he had never seen anything like him. “I need to break into a Gringotts vault.” Harry had not meant to say it so baldly; the words were forced from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad. “Harry —” said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. “Break  into  a  Gringotts  vault?”  repeated  the  goblin,  wincing  a little as he shifted his position upon the bed. “It is impossible.” “No, it isn’t,” Ron contradicted him. “It’s been done.” “Yeah,” said Harry. “The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.” “The vault in question was empty at the time,” snapped the gob-lin,  and  Harry  understood  that  even  though  Griphook  had  left Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defenses being breached. “Its protection was minimal.” “Well, the vault we need to get into isn’t empty, and I’m guess-ing its protection will be pretty powerful,” said Harry. “It belongs to the Lestranges.” He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer. “You have no chance,” said Griphook flatly. “No chance at all. If  you seek beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours —” “Thief, you have been warned, beware — yeah, I know, I remember,” (cid:145) 487 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR said Harry. “But I’m not trying to get myself any treasure, I’m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe that?” The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry’s  forehead  prickled,  but  he  ignored  it,  refusing  to  acknowl-edge its pain or its invitation. “If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain,” said Griphook finally, “it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the re-spect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.” “Wand-carriers,” repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts north-ward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door. “The right to carry a wand,” said the  goblin  quietly,  “has  long been contested between wizards and goblins.” “Well, goblins can do magic without wands,” said Ron. “That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of ex-tending our powers!” “Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” said Ron. “You won’t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do.  Goblins  know  how  to  work  metal  in  a  way  wizards  have never —” “It doesn’t matter,” said Harry, noting Griphook’s rising color. “This isn’t about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magi-cal creature —” Griphook gave a nasty laugh. “But it is, it is about precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, your race is set still more firmly above mine!   (cid:145) 488 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER Gringotts  falls  under  Wizarding  rule,  house-elves  are  slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?” “We do!” said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. “We protest! And I’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I’m a Mudblood!” “Don’t call yourself —” Ron muttered. “Why shouldn’t I?” said Hermione. “Mudblood, and proud of it! I’ve got no higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys’!” As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat. “Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?” she asked. “Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years?” (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione’s chair.) “You can’t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!” The  goblin  gazed  at  Hermione  with  the  same  curiosity  he  had shown Harry. “What  do  you  seek  within  the  Lestranges’  vault?”  he  asked abruptly.  “The  sword  that  lies  inside  it  is  a  fake.  This  is  the  real one.” He looked from one to the other of them. “I think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.” “But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, is it?” asked Harry. “Perhaps you’ve seen the other things in there?” His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his ef-forts to ignore the pulsing of his scar. The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. “It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the   (cid:145) 489 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR objects  placed  in  our  care,  which  were,  so  often,  wrought  by  our fingers.” The  goblin  stroked  the  sword,  and  his  black  eyes  roved  from Harry to Hermione to Ron and then back again. “So young,” he said finally, “to be fighting so many.” “Will you help us?” said Harry. “We haven’t got a hope of break-ing in without a goblin’s help. You’re our one chance.” “I shall . . . think about it,” said Griphook maddeningly. “But —” Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. “Thank you,” said Harry. The  goblin  bowed  his  great  domed  head  in  acknowledgement, then flexed his short legs. “I think,” he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur’s bed, “that the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .” “Yeah,  of  course,”  said  Harry,  but  before  leaving  the  room  he leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resent-ment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him. “Little  git,”  whispered  Ron.  “He’s  enjoying  keeping  us hanging.” “Harry,”  whispered  Hermione,  pulling  them  both  away  from the door, into the middle of the still-dark landing, “are you saying what I think you’re saying? Are you saying there’s a Horcrux in the Lestranges’ vault?” “Yes,” said Harry. “Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we’d been in there, she was beside herself. Why? What did she think we’d seen, what else did she think we might have taken? Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.” (cid:145) 490 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER “But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who’s been, places he’s done something important?” said Ron, looking baffled. “Was he ever inside the Lestranges’ vault?” “I don’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,” said Harry. “He  never  had  gold  there  when  he  was  younger,  because  nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.” Harry’s  scar  throbbed,  but  he  ignored  it;  he  wanted  Ron  and Hermione  to  understand  about  Gringotts  before  they  spoke  to Ollivander. “I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Grin-gotts vault. I think he’d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don’t forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it the night he came back, I heard him.” Harry rubbed his scar. “I don’t think he’d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He prob-ably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me . . . except for Hogwarts.” When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head. “You really understand him.” “Bits of him,” said Harry. “Bits . . . I just wish I’d understood Dum-bledore as much. But we’ll see. Come on — Ollivander now.” Ron  and  Hermione  looked  bewildered  but  impressed  as  they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur’s. A weak “Come in!” answered them. (cid:145) 491 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR The  wandmaker  was  lying  on  the  twin  bed  farthest  from  the window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and the freshly dug grave. “Mr. Ollivander, I’m sorry to disturb you,” Harry said. “My dear boy.” Ollivander’s voice was feeble. “You rescued us. I thought we would die in that place. I can never thank you . . . never thank you . . . enough.” “We were glad to do it.” Harry’s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic . . . yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. Feign-ing a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand. “Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.” “Anything. Anything,” said the wandmaker weakly. “Can you mend this? Is it possible?” Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected halves into his palm. “Holly  and  phoenix  feather,”  said  Ollivander  in  a  tremulous voice. “Eleven inches. Nice and supple.” “Yes,” said Harry. “Can you — ?” “No,” whispered Ollivander. “I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand (cid:145) 492 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.” Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He  took  the  wand  halves  back  and  replaced  them  in  the  pouch around  his  neck.  Ollivander  stared  at  the  place  where  the  shat-tered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken  from  his  pocket  the  two  wands  he  had  brought  from  the Malfoys’. “Can you identify these?” Harry asked. The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flex-ing it slightly. “Walnut  and  dragon  heartstring,”  he  said.  “Twelve-and-three-quarter  inches.  Unyielding.  This  wand  belonged  to  Bellatrix Lestrange.” “And this one?” Ollivander performed the same examination. “Hawthorn  and  unicorn  hair.  Ten  inches  precisely.  Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.” “Was?” repeated Harry. “Isn’t it still his?” “Perhaps not. If you took it —” “— I did —” “— then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking mat-ters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.” There was silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea. “You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings,” said Harry, “like they can think for themselves.” (cid:145) 493 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR “The wand chooses the wizard,” said Ollivander. “That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.” “A person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen them, though?” asked Harry. “Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. The best results, how-ever, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attrac-tion,  and  then  a  mutual  quest  for  experience,  the  wand  learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.” The  sea  gushed  forward  and  backward;  it  was  a  mournful sound. “I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,” said Harry. “Can I use it safely?” “I  think  so.  Subtle  laws  govern  wand  ownership,  but  the  con-quered wand will usually bend its will to its new master.” “So I should use this one?” said Ron, pulling Wormtail’s wand out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander. “Chestnut  and  dragon  heartstring.  Nine-and-a-quarter  inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bid-ding, and do it well, than another wand.” “And this holds true for all wands, does it?” asked Harry. “I think so,” replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Har-ry’s face. “You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.” “So, it isn’t necessary to kill the previous owner to take true pos-session of a wand?” asked Harry. Ollivander swallowed. (cid:145) 494 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER “Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.” “There  are  legends,  though,”  said  Harry,  and  as  his  heart  rate quickened,  the  pain  in  his  scar  became  more  intense;  he  was  sure that Voldemort had decided to put his idea into action. “Legends about a wand — or wands — that have passed from hand to hand by murder.” Ollivander  turned  pale.  Against  the  snowy  pillow  he  was  light gray, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. “Only one wand, I think,” he whispered. “And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn’t he?” asked Harry. “I  —  how?”  croaked  Ollivander,  and  he  looked  appealingly  at Ron and Hermione for help. “How do you know this?” “He  wanted  you  to  tell  him  how  to  overcome  the  connection between our wands,” said Harry. Ollivander looked terrified. “He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I — I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!” “I understand,” said Harry. “You told him about the twin cores? You said he just had to borrow another wizard’s wand?” Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He nodded slowly. “But it didn’t work,” Harry went on. “Mine still beat the bor-rowed wand. Do you know why that is?” Ollivander shook his head as slowly as he had just nodded. “I had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique that night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly  rare,  yet  why  your  wand  should  have  snapped  the  bor-rowed wand, I do not know. . . .” (cid:145) 495 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR “We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands  by  murder.  When  You-Know-Who  realized  my  wand  had done something strange, he came back and asked about that other wand, didn’t he?” “How do you know this?” Harry did not answer. “Yes, he asked,” whispered Ollivander. “He wanted to know ev-erything  I  could  tell  him  about  the  wand  variously  known  as  the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.” Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted. “The Dark Lord,” said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, “had  always  been  happy  with  the  wand  I  made  him  —  yew  and phoenix  feather,  thirteen-and-a-half  inches  —  until  he  discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more pow-erful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.” “But he’ll know soon, if he doesn’t already, that mine’s broken beyond repair,” said Harry quietly. “No!” said Hermione, sounding frightened. “He can’t know that, Harry, how could he — ?” “Priori  Incantatem,”  said  Harry.  “We  left  your  wand  and  the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys’, Hermione. If they examine them properly,  make  them  re-create  the  spells  they’ve  cast  lately,  they’ll see  that  yours  broke  mine,  they’ll  see  that  you  tried  and  failed  to mend it, and they’ll realize that I’ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.” The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, “Let’s not worry about that now —” But Mr. Ollivander intervened. (cid:145) 496 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER “The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.” “And will it?” “The  owner  of  the  Elder  Wand  must  always  fear  attack,”  said Ollivander,  “but  the  idea  of  the  Dark  Lord  in  possession  of  the Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable.” Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when they first met, of how much he liked Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him. “You — you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?” asked Hermione. “Oh yes,” said Ollivander. “Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand’s course through history. There are gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always  it  resurfaces.  It  has  certain  identifying  characteristics  that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written ac-counts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity.” “So you — you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?” Her-mione asked hopefully. “No,” said Ollivander. “Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards.  Immensely  powerful,  dangerous  in  the  wrong  hands,  and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.” (cid:145) 497 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR “Mr.  Ollivander,”  said  Harry,  “you  told  You-Know-Who  that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn’t you?” Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. “But how — how do you — ?” “Never mind how I know it,” said Harry, closing his eyes mo-mentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther  north.  “You  told  You-Know-Who  that  Gregorovitch  had the wand?” “It  was  a  rumor,”  whispered  Ollivander.  “A  rumor,  years  and years ago, long before you were born! I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it would be for business: that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!” “Yes, I can see that,” said Harry. He stood up. “Mr. Ollivander, one last thing, and then we’ll let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?” “The  —  the  what?”  asked  the  wandmaker,  looking  utterly bewildered. “The Deathly Hallows.” “I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about. Is this still something to do with wands?” Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He did not know about the Hallows. “Thank  you,”  said  Harry.  “Thank  you  very  much.  We’ll  leave you to get some rest now.” Ollivander looked stricken. “He was torturing me!” he gasped. “The Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no idea. . . .” (cid:145) 498 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER “I do,” said Harry. “I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this.” He led Ron and  Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught a glimpse  of  Bill,  Fleur,  Luna,  and  Dean  sitting  at  the  table  in  the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and con-tinued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully. It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were forc-ing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory was right. He must make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione. “Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,” he said. “I saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn’t have it anymore: It was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know — but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can’t have been that difficult.” Voldemort  was  at  the  gates  of  Hogwarts;  Harry  could  see  him standing there, and see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, com-ing closer and closer. “And  Grindelwald  used  the  Elder  Wand  to  become  powerful. And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand.” “Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?” said Ron. “But then — where is it now?” (cid:145) 499 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR “At Hogwarts,” said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden. “But then, let’s go!” said Ron urgently. “Harry, let’s go and get it before he does!” “It’s  too  late  for  that,”  said  Harry.  He  could  not  help  himself, but clutched his head, trying to help it resist. “He knows where it is. He’s there now.” “Harry!” Ron said furiously. “How long have you known this — why  have  we  been  wasting  time?  Why  did  you  talk  to  Griphook first? We could have gone — we could still go —” “No,” said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. “Hermi-one’s right. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.” “The unbeatable wand, Harry!” moaned Ron. “I’m not supposed to . . . I’m supposed to get the Horcruxes. . . .” And now everything was cool and dark: The sun was barely vis-ible over the horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake. “I shall join you in the castle shortly,” he said in his high, cold voice. “Leave me now.” Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billow-ing behind him. Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape’s figure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal himself . . . and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even from his own eyes. And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the out-lines of the beloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright. . . . (cid:145) 500 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  WANDMAKER And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white marble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that heady sense of purpose  in  destruction.  He  raised  the  old  yew  wand:  How  fitting that this would be its last great act. The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long and thin as it had been in life. He raised the wand again. The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken, yet almost perfectly preserved. They had left his  spectacles on the crooked  nose:  He  felt  amused  derision.  Dumbledore’s  hands  were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, bur-ied with him. Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? Had he thought that the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the wand from Dumbledore’s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of sparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last. (cid:145) 501 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E N T Y - F I V E SHELL COTTAGE     B ill and Fleur’s cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still  scared  Harry.  He  could  not  remember,  ever  before,  choosing not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together. “What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?” “What if working out what the symbol meant made you ‘worthy’ to get the Hallows?” “Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-Who?” (cid:145) 502 (cid:145) \\x0cSHELL  COTTAGE Harry  had  no  answers:  There  were  moments  when  he  wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Volde-mort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain satisfacto-rily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to reconstruct the  internal  arguments  that  had  led  to  his  decision,  they  sounded feebler to him. The odd thing was that Hermione’s support made him feel just as confused as Ron’s doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered. “You  could  never  have  done  that,  Harry,”  she  said  again  and again. “You couldn’t have broken into Dumbledore’s grave.” But the idea of Dumbledore’s corpse frightened Harry much less than  the  possibility  that  he  might  have  misunderstood  the  living Dumbledore’s  intentions.  He  felt  that  he  was  still  groping  in  the dark;  he  had  chosen  his  path  but  kept  looking  back,  wondering whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died. “But is he dead?” said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument. “Yes, he is, Ron, please don’t start that again!” “Look at the facts, Hermione,” said Ron, speaking across Harry, (cid:145) 503 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE who continued to gaze at the horizon. “The silver doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror —” “Harry  admits  he  could  have  imagined  the  eye!  Don’t  you, Harry?” “I could have,” said Harry without looking at her. “But you don’t think you did, do you?” asked Ron. “No, I don’t,” said Harry. “There you go!” said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. “If it wasn’t Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?” “I can’t — but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?” “I dunno, it could’ve been his ghost!” “Dumbledore wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said Harry. There was little about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that much. “He would have gone on.” “What  d’you  mean,  ‘gone  on’?”  asked  Ron,  but  before  Harry could say any more, a voice behind them said, “ ’Arry?” Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze. “ ’Arry, Grip’ook would like to speak to you. ’E eez in ze smallest bedroom, ’e says ’e does not want to be over’eard.” Her  dislike  of  the  goblin  sending  her  to  deliver  messages  was clear; she looked irritable as she walked back around the house. Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage’s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage. (cid:145) 504 (cid:145) \\x0cSHELL  COTTAGE “I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,” said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly  fingers.  “Though  the  goblins  of  Gringotts  will  consider  it base treachery, I have decided to help you —” “That’s great!” said Harry, relief surging through him. “Griphook, thank you, we’re really —” “— in return,” said the goblin firmly, “for payment.” Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. “How much do you want? I’ve got gold.” “Not gold,” said Griphook. “I have gold.” His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. “I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.” Harry’s spirits plummeted. “You can’t have that,” he said. “I’m sorry.” “Then,” said the goblin softly, “we have a problem.” “We can give you something else,” said Ron eagerly. “I’ll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault.” He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily. “I  am  not  a  thief,  boy!  I  am  not  trying  to  procure  treasures  to which I have no right!” “The sword’s ours —” “It is not,” said the goblin. “We’re Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor’s —” “And  before  it  was  Gryffindor’s,  whose  was  it?”  demanded  the goblin, sitting up straight. “No one’s,” said Ron. “It was made for him, wasn’t it?” “No!” cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. “Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk (cid:145) 505 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE the First’s, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the goblins! The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!” Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then said, “We need to discuss this, Griphook, if that’s all right. Could you give us a few minutes?” The goblin nodded, looking sour. Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fire-place, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, “He’s having a laugh. We can’t let him have that sword.” “It  is  true?”  Harry  asked  Hermione.  “Was  the  sword  stolen  by Gryffindor?” “I don’t know,” she said hopelessly. “Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there’s no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.” “It’ll be one of those goblin stories,” said Ron, “about how the wiz-ards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.” “Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron,” said Her-mione. “They’ve been treated brutally in the past.” “Goblins  aren’t  exactly  fluffy  little  bunnies,  though,  are  they?” said Ron. “They’ve killed plenty of us. They’ve fought dirty too.” “But  arguing  with  Griphook  about  whose  race  is  most  under-handed and violent isn’t going to make him more likely to help us, is it?” There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked out of the window at Dobby’s grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone. “Okay,”  said  Ron,  and  Harry  turned  back  to  face  him,  “how’s (cid:145) 506 (cid:145) \\x0cSHELL  COTTAGE this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault, and then he can have it. There’s a fake in there, isn’t there? We switch them, and give him the fake.” “Ron, he’d know the difference better than we would!” said Her-mione. “He’s the only one who realized there had been a swap!” “Yeah, but we could scarper before he realizes —” He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him. “That,”  she  said  quietly,  “is  despicable.  Ask  for  his  help,  then double-cross him? And you wonder why goblins don’t like wizards, Ron?” Ron’s ears had turned red. “All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What’s your solution, then?” “We  need  to  offer  him  something  else,  something  just  as valuable.” “Brilliant. I’ll go and get one of our other ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap it.” Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of  the  sea.  The  idea  that  Gryffindor  might  have  stolen  the  sword was unpleasant to him: He had always been proud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor  had  been  the  champion  of  Muggle-borns,  the  wizard who had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin. . . . “Maybe he’s lying,” Harry said, opening his eyes again. “Griphook. Maybe  Gryffindor  didn’t  take  the  sword.  How  do  we  know  the goblin version of history’s right?” (cid:145) 507 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE “Does it make a difference?” asked Hermione. “Changes how I feel about it,” said Harry. He took a deep breath. “We’ll  tell  him  he  can  have  the  sword  after  he’s  helped  us  get into that vault — but we’ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it.” A  grin  spread  slowly  across  Ron’s  face.  Hermione,  however, looked alarmed. “Harry, we can’t —” “He can have it,” Harry went on, “after we’ve used it on all of the Horcruxes. I’ll make sure he gets it then. I’ll keep my word.” “But that could be years!” said Hermione. “I know that, but he needn’t. I won’t be lying . . . really.” Harry  met  her  eyes  with  a  mixture  of  defiance  and  shame.  He remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard: For the Greater Good. He pushed the idea away. What choice did they have? “I don’t like it,” said Hermione. “Nor do I, much,” Harry admitted. “Well, I think it’s genius,” said Ron, standing up again. “Let’s go and tell him.” Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry. “I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?” “Yes,” said Harry. (cid:145) 508 (cid:145) \\x0cSHELL  COTTAGE “Then shake,” said the goblin, holding out his hand. Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, “So. We begin!” It  was  like  planning  to  break  into  the  Ministry  all  over  again. They settled to work in the smallest bedroom, which was kept, ac-cording to Griphook’s preference, in semidarkness. “I  have  visited  the  Lestranges’  vault  only  once,”  Griphook  told them, “on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected. . . .” They remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time. Slowly the days stretched into weeks. There was problem after prob-lem to overcome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted. “There’s really only enough left for one of us,” said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight. “That’ll be enough,” said Harry, who was examining Griphook’s hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways. The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione only  emerged  for  mealtimes.  Nobody  asked  questions,  although Harry often felt Bill’s eyes on the three of them at the table, thought-ful, concerned. The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did  not  much  like  the  goblin.  Griphook  was  unexpectedly  blood-thirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures, and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards (cid:145) 509 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE to reach the Lestranges’ vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it: They needed Griphook. The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued  to request trays of food in his room,  like  the  still-frail  Ollivander,  until  Bill  (following  an  angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the over-crowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi. Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work. “I’m sorry,” he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. “I never meant you to have to deal with all of this.” She  had  just  set  some  knives  to  work,  chopping  up  steaks  for Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he  had  been  attacked  by  Greyback.  While  the  knives  sliced  away behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened. “ ’Arry, you saved my sister’s life, I do not forget.” This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had never been in real danger. “Anyway,” Fleur went on, pointing her wand at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to bubble at once, “Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel’s zis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze goblin,” she scowled a little at the mention of him, “can move downstairs, and you, Ron, and Dean can take zat room.” (cid:145) 510 (cid:145) \\x0cSHELL  COTTAGE “We don’t mind sleeping in the living room,” said Harry, who knew that Griphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. “Don’t worry about us.” And when she tried to protest he went on, “We’ll be off your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won’t need to be here much longer.” “But what do you mean?” she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair. “Of course you must not leave, you are safe ’ere!” She  looked  rather  like  Mrs.  Weasley  as  she  said  it,  and  he  was glad  that  the  back  door  opened  at  that  moment.  Luna  and  Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood. “. . . and tiny little ears,” Luna was saying, “a bit like a hippo’s, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast. . . .” Looking  uncomfortable,  Dean  shrugged  at  Harry  as  he  passed, following Luna into the combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. Seizing the chance to  escape  Fleur’s  questions,  Harry  grabbed  two  jugs  of  pumpkin juice and followed them. “. . . and if you ever come to our house I’ll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven’t seen it yet, be-cause the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas,” Luna was saying, as she and Dean relaid the fire. “Luna, we told you,” Hermione called over to her. “That horn exploded.  It  came  from  an  Erumpent,  not  a  Crumple-Horned Snorkack —” (cid:145) 511 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE “No,  it  was  definitely  a  Snorkack  horn,”  said  Luna  serenely. “Daddy told me. It will probably have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know.” Hermione  shook  her  head  and  continued  laying  down  forks  as Bill appeared, leading Mr. Ollivander down the stairs. The wand-maker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill’s arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase. “I’m going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,” said Luna, approaching the old man. “And I you, my dear,” said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. “You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.” “So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,” said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. “And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill’s Auntie Muriel? I never returned ’er tiara.” “It will be an honor,” said Ollivander with a little bow, “the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.” Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. “Moonstones and diamonds,” said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry noticing. “Made by goblins, I think?” “And paid for by wizards,” said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging. A  strong  wind  gusted  against  the  cottage  windows  as  Bill  and Ollivander  set  off  into  the  night.  The  rest  of  them  squeezed  in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside  them.  Fleur,  Harry  noticed,  was  merely  playing  with  her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; however, Bill (cid:145) 512 (cid:145) \\x0cSHELL  COTTAGE returned  before  they  had  finished  their  first  course,  his  long  hair tangled by the wind. “Everything’s fine,” he told Fleur. “Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her love. Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they’re still operating an Owl-Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she thought we’d stolen it.” “Ah,  she  eez  charmante,  your  aunt,”  said  Fleur  crossly,  waving her  wand  and  causing  the  dirty  plates  to  rise  and  form  a  stack  in midair. She caught them and marched out of the room. “Daddy’s made a tiara,” piped up Luna. “Well, more of a crown, really.” Ron  caught  Harry’s  eye  and  grinned;  Harry  knew  that  he  was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius. “Yes, he’s trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he’s identified most of the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference —” There was a bang on the front door. Everyone’s head turned to-ward it. Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feet, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight. “Who is it?” Bill called. “It  is  I,  Remus  John  Lupin!”  called  a  voice  over  the  howling wind. Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? “I am a  werewolf,  married  to  Nymphadora  Tonks,  and  you,  the  Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!” (cid:145) 513 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE “Lupin,” muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling  cloak,  his  graying  hair  windswept.  He  straightened  up, looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried aloud, “It’s a boy! We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s father!” Hermione shrieked. “Wha — ? Tonks — Tonks has had the baby?” “Yes,  yes,  she’s  had  the  baby!”  shouted  Lupin.  All  around  the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both squealed, “Congratulations!” and Ron said, “Blimey, a baby!” as if he had never heard of such a thing before. “Yes — yes — a boy,” said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He strode around the table and hugged Harry; the  scene  in  the  basement  of  Grimmauld  Place  might  never  have happened. “You’ll be godfather?” he said as he released Harry. “M-me?” stammered Harry “You, yes, of course — Dora quite agrees, no one better —” “I — yeah — blimey —” Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hur-rying to fetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink. “I can’t stay long, I must get back,” said Lupin, beaming around at them all: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him. “Thank you, thank you, Bill.” Bill  had  soon  filled  all  of  their  goblets,  they  stood  and  raised them high in a toast.  (cid:145) 514 (cid:145) \\x0cSHELL  COTTAGE “To  Teddy  Remus  Lupin,”  said  Lupin,  “a  great  wizard  in  the making!” “ ’Oo does ’e look like?” Fleur inquired. “I  think  he  looks  like  Dora,  but  she  thinks  he  is  like  me.  Not much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it’s turned ginger in the hour since. Probably be blond by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks’s hair started changing color the day that she was born.” He drained his goblet. “Oh, go on then, just one more,” he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again. The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and  Bill  was  soon  opening  another  bottle  of  wine.  Lupin’s  news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched  by  the  suddenly  festive  atmo-sphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now oc-cupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up the stairs. “No . . . no . . . I really must get back,” said Lupin at last, declin-ing  yet  another  goblet  of  wine.  He  got  to  his  feet  and  pulled  his traveling cloak back around himself. “Good-bye, good-bye — I’ll try and bring some pictures in a few days’ time — they’ll all be so glad to know that I’ve seen you —” He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night. “Godfather,  Harry!”  said  Bill  as  they  walked  into  the  kitchen together, helping clear the table. “A real honor! Congratulations!” As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled   (cid:145) 515 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE the door behind him closed, shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin’s absence. “I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn’t been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.” Bill hesitated. “Harry, you’re planning something with Griphook.” It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting. “I know goblins,” said Bill. “I’ve worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards and  goblins,  I  have  goblin  friends  —  or,  at  least,  goblins  I  know well, and like.” Again, Bill hesitated. “Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return?” “I can’t tell you that,” said Harry. “Sorry, Bill.” The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets. “Wait,” Bill told her. “Just a moment.” She backed out and he closed the door again. “Then I have to say this,” Bill went on. “If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and  most  particularly  if  that  bar-gain  involves  treasure,  you  must  be  exceptionally  careful.  Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones.” Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. “What do you mean?” he asked. “We are talking about a different breed of being,” said Bill.   (cid:145) 516 (cid:145) \\x0cSHELL  COTTAGE “Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for cen-turies — but you’ll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership.” “I respect —” Harry began, but Bill shook his head. “You don’t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true mas-ter of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin-made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.” “But if it was bought —” “—  then  they  would  consider  it  rented  by  the  one  who  had paid the money. They have, however, great difficulty with the idea of  goblin-made  objects  passing  from  wizard  to  wizard.  You  saw Griphook’s  face  when  the  tiara  passed  under  his  eyes.  He  disap-proves.  I  believe  he  thinks,  as  do  the  fiercest  of  his  kind,  that  it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original pur-chaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than theft.” Harry  had  an  ominous  feeling  now;  he  wondered  whether  Bill guessed more than he was letting on. “All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, “is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.”  (cid:145) 517 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE “Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah. Thanks. I’ll bear that in mind.” As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him. (cid:145) 518 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E N T Y - S I X  GRINGOTTS    T heir  plans  were  made,  their  preparations  complete;  in  the smallest  bedroom  a  single  long,  coarse  black  hair  (plucked from the sweater Hermione had been wearing at Malfoy Manor) lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece. “And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said Harry, nodding to-ward the walnut wand, “so I reckon you’ll be pretty convincing.” Hermione  looked  frightened  that  the  wand  might  sting  or  bite her as she picked it up. “I hate this thing,” she said in a low voice. “I really hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn’t work properly for me. . . . It’s like a bit of her.” Harry  could  not  help  but  remember  how  Hermione  had  dis-missed  his  loathing  of  the  blackthorn  wand,  insisting  that  he  was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling him to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however; the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her. (cid:145) 519 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX “It’ll  probably  help  you  get  in  character,  though,”  said  Ron. “Think what that wand’s done!” “But  that’s  my  point!”  said  Hermione.  “This  is  the  wand  that tortured Neville’s mum and dad, and who knows how many other people? This is the wand that killed Sirius!” Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryf-findor’s sword, which was propped against the wall beside him. “I miss my wand,” Hermione said miserably. “I wish Mr. Olli-vander could have made me another one too.” Mr.  Ollivander  had  sent  Luna  a  new  wand  that  morning.  She was out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily. Harry  looked  down  at  the  hawthorn  wand  that  had  once  be-longed  to  Draco  Malfoy.  He  had  been  surprised,  but  pleased,  to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione’s had done.  Remembering  what  Ollivander  had  told  them  of  the  secret workings of wands, Harry thought he knew what Hermione’s prob-lem was: She had not won the walnut wand’s allegiance by taking it personally from Bellatrix. The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at once: He could tell that the gob-lin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said, “We’ve just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We’ve told Bill and Fleur we’re leaving tomorrow, and we’ve told them not to get up to see us off.” They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need (cid:145) 520 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS to transform into Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur  knew  or  suspected  about  what  they  were  about  to  do,  the better. They had also explained that they would not be returning. As they had lost Perkins’s old tent on the night that the Snatchers caught  them,  Bill  had  lent  them  another  one.  It  was  now  packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Her-mione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down her sock. Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to men-tion the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry  was  looking  forward  to  escaping  the  confinement  of  Shell Cottage.  He  was  tired  of  trying  to  make  sure  that  they  were  not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor’s sword remained a question to which Harry had no answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than  five  minutes  at  a  time:  “He  could  give  my  mother  lessons,” growled Ron, as the goblin’s long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill’s warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery. Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it; Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a  few  Griphook-free  moments,  had  come  up  with  nothing  better than “We’ll just have to wing it, mate.” Harry slept badly that night. Lying awake in the early hours, he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had (cid:145) 521 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, almost  an  excitement.  Now  he  was  experiencing  jolts  of  anxiety, nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too was  awake,  but  they  were  sharing  the  sitting  room  with  Dean,  so Harry did not speak. It was a relief when six o’clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The dawn  was  chilly,  but  there  was  little  wind  now  that  it  was  May. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff: He was going to miss the sound. Small  green  shoots  were  forcing  their  way  up  through  the  red earth of Dobby’s grave now; in a year’s time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf’s name had al-ready acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. His fingers moved absentmindedly to the little  pouch  still  strung  around  his  neck,  through  which  he  could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen  Dumbledore’s  eye.  Then  the  sound  of  a  door  opening  made him look around. Bellatrix  Lestrange  was  striding  across  the  lawn  toward  them, (cid:145) 522 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS accompanied  by  Griphook.  As  she  walked,  she  was  tucking  the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress a  shiver  of  loathing.  She  was  taller  than  he  was,  her  long  black hair  rippling  down  her  back,  her  heavily  lidded  eyes  disdainful  as they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione through Bellatrix’s low voice. “She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so I can do you. . . .” “Right, but remember, I don’t like the beard too long —” “Oh,  for  heaven’s  sake,  this  isn’t  about  looking  handsome  —” “It’s not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you did last time.” Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as  she  transformed  various  aspects  of  Ron’s  appearance.  He  was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to the  malevolent  aura  cast  by  Bellatrix  to  protect  him.  Meanwhile Harry  and  Griphook  were  to  be  concealed  under  the  Invisibility Cloak. “There,” said Hermione, “how does he look, Harry?” It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought, because he knew him so well. Ron’s hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freck-les, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows. “Well, he’s not my type, but he’ll do,” said Harry. “Shall we go, then?” All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward (cid:145) 523 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Charm stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook spoke. “I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?” Harry  bent  down  and  the  goblin  clambered  onto  his  back,  his hands linked in front of Harry’s throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked  the  feeling  of  the  goblin  and  the  surprising  strength  with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both. “Perfect,” she said, bending down to check Harry’s feet. “I can’t see a thing. Let’s go.” Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, con-centrating with all his might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter as  they  moved  into  the  compressing  darkness,  and  seconds  later Harry’s  feet  found  pavement  and  he  opened  his  eyes  on  Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn’s existence. The  bar  of  the  Leaky  Cauldron  was  nearly  deserted.  Tom,  the stooped  and  toothless  landlord,  was  polishing  glasses  behind  the bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in  the  far  corner  glanced  at  Hermione  and  drew  back  into  the shadows. “Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined his head subserviently. “Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying  Griphook  piggyback  under  the  Cloak,  he  saw  Tom  look surprised. “Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed (cid:145) 524 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS out of the inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like they’re scum!” “Okay, okay!” Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand  and  tapped  a  brick  in  the nondescript wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and  wider,  finally  forming  an  archway  onto  the  narrow  cobbled street that was Diagon Alley. It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered  now  from  the  bustling  place  Harry  had  visited  before  his first term at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever were  boarded  up,  though  several  new  establishments  dedicated  to the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit. Harry’s own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows, al-ways captioned with the words undesirable number one. A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them  moaning  to  the  few  passersby,  pleading  for  gold,  insisting that they were really wizards. One man had a bloody bandage over his eye. As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. They  seemed  to  melt  away  before  her,  drawing  hoods  over  their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came stagger-ing right across her path. “My  children!”  he  bellowed,  pointing  at  her.  His  voice  was cracked, high-pitched; he sounded distraught. “Where are my chil-dren? What has he done with them? You know, you know!” “I — I really —” stammered Hermione. (cid:145) 525 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then, with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passersby  gathered  their  robes  about  them  and  broke  into  gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene. Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. Before they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry from behind them. “Why, Madam Lestrange!” Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry’s neck: A tall, thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them. “It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into Harry’s ear, but at that mo-ment Harry could not think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to her fullest height and said with as much contempt as she could muster: “And what do you want?” Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted. “He’s another Death Eater!” breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into Hermione’s ear. “I  merely  sought  to  greet  you,”  said  Travers  coolly,  “but  if  my presence is not welcome . . .” Harry  recognized  his  voice  now;  Travers  was  one  of  the  Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house.  (cid:145) 526 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS “No, no, not at all, Travers,” said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up her mistake. “How are you?” “Well,  I  confess  I  am  surprised  to  see  you  out  and  about, Bellatrix.” “Really? Why?” asked Hermione. “Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the house, after the . . . ah . . . escape.” Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If  this was true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public — “The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faith-fully in the past,” said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bel-latrix’s most contemptuous manner. “Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is, Travers.” Though  the  Death  Eater  looked  offended,  he  also  seemed  less suspicious. He glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned. “How did it offend you?” “It  does  not  matter,  it  will  not  do  so  again,”  said  Hermione coolly. “Some  of  these  wandless  can  be  troublesome,”  said  Travers. “While they do nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case at the Ministry last week. ‘I’m a witch, sir, I’m a witch, let me prove it to you!’ ” he said in a squeaky impersonation. “As if I was going to give her my wand — but whose wand,” said Travers curiously, “are you using at the moment, Bel-latrix? I heard that your own was —” “I have my wand here,” said Hermione coldly, holding up Bella-trix’s wand. “I don’t know what rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed.”  (cid:145) 527 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron. “Who is your friend? I do not recognize him.” “This  is  Dragomir  Despard,”  said  Hermione;  they  had  decided that  a  fictional  foreigner  was  the  safest  cover  for  Ron  to  assume. “He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord’s aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime.” “Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?” “ ’Ow you?” said Ron, holding out his hand. Travers  extended  two  fingers  and  shook  Ron’s  hand  as  though frightened of dirtying himself. “So  what  brings  you  and  your  —  ah  —  sympathetic  friend  to Diagon Alley this early?” asked Travers. “I need to visit Gringotts,” said Hermione. “Alas,  I  also,”  said  Travers.  “Gold,  filthy  gold!  We  cannot  live without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends.” Harry felt Griphook’s clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck. “Shall we?” said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward. Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked, cobbled street toward the place where the snowy-white  Gringotts  stood  towering  over  the  other  little  shops.  Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed. A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side, there was no means for Harry to communicate with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot of the (cid:145) 528 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance  had  been  replaced  by  two  wizards,  both  of  whom  were clutching long thin golden rods. “Ah, Probity Probes,” sighed Travers theatrically, “so crude — but effective!” And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wiz-ards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds; Harry pointed Draco’s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, “Confundo” twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them. Hermione’s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps. “One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his Probe. “But  you’ve  just  done  that!”  said  Hermione  in  Bellatrix’s  com-manding,  arrogant  voice.  Travers  looked  around,  eyebrows  raised. The guard was confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, “Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.” Hermione swept forward, Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them. Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold: The wizards were both scratching their heads. Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver  and  which  carried  the  poem  warning  of  dire  retribution  to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to him: standing on this very spot on the day (cid:145) 529 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX that he had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, “Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed, and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal. . . . But within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank. The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools, serving the first customers of the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron. The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, “Leprechaun,” and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back to him. Hermione stepped forward. “Madam  Lestrange!”  said  the  goblin,  evidently  startled.  “Dear me! How — how may I help you today?” “I wish to enter my vault,” said Hermione. The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not  only  was  Travers  hanging  back,  watching,  but  several  other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione. “You have . . . identification?” asked the goblin. “Identification?  I  —  I  have  never  been  asked  for  identification before!” said Hermione. “They know!” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear. “They must have been warned there might be an impostor!” “Your  wand  will  do,  madam,”  said  the  goblin.  He  held  out  a slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry (cid:145) 530 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix’s wand had been stolen. “Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear, “the Im-perius Curse!” Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it  at  the  old  goblin,  and  whispered,  for  the  first  time  in  his  life, “Imperio!” A curious sensation shot down Harry’s arm, a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix’s wand, examined it closely, and then said, “Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!” “What?” said Hermione. “No, no, that’s mine —” “A new wand?” said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the  goblins  all  around  were  watching.  “But  how  could  you  have done, which wandmaker did you use?” Harry acted without thinking: Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, “Imperio!” once more. “Oh yes, I see,” said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix’s wand, “yes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don’t you?” Hermione  looked  utterly  bewildered,  but  to  Harry’s  enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment. The  old  goblin  behind  the  counter  clapped  his  hands  and  a younger goblin approached. “I shall need the Clankers,” he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. “Good, good! So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,” said the old goblin, (cid:145) 531 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight, “I shall take you to your vault.” He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily to-ward  them,  the  contents  of  the  leather  bag  still  jingling.  Travers was  now  standing  quite  still  with  his  mouth  hanging  wide  open. Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion. “Wait — Bogrod!” Another goblin came scurrying around the counter. “We have instructions,” he said with a bow to Hermione. “For-give me, Madam, but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.” He whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off. “I  am  aware  of  the  instructions.  Madam  Lestrange  wishes  to visit her vault. . . . Very old family . . . old clients . . . This way, please . . .” And,  still  clanking,  he  hurried  toward  one  of  the  many  doors leading  off  the  hall.  Harry  looked  back  at  Travers,  who  was  still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his deci-sion: With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flam-ing torches. “We’re in trouble; they suspect,” said Harry as the door slammed behind  them  and  he  pulled  off  the  Invisibility  Cloak.  Griphook jumped  down  from  his  shoulders;  neither  Travers  nor  Bogrod showed  the  slightest  surprise  at  the  sudden  appearance  of  Harry Potter in their midst. “They’re Imperiused,” he added, in response (cid:145) 532 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS to Hermione and Ron’s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. “I don’t think I did it strongly enough, I don’t know. . . .” And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bel-latrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: “You need to mean them, Potter!” “What do we do?” asked Ron. “Shall we get out now, while we can?” “If we can,” said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, beyond which who knew what was happening. “We’ve got this far, I say we go on,” said Harry. “Good!” said Griphook. “So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no longer have the authority. But there will not be room for the wizard.” Harry pointed his wand at Travers. “Imperio!” The  wizard  turned  and  set  off  along  the  dark  track  at  a  smart pace. “What are you making him do?” “Hide,”  said  Harry  as  he  pointed  his  wand  at  Bogrod,  who whistled  to  summon  a  little  cart  that  came  trundling  along  the tracks  toward  them  out  of  the  darkness.  Harry  was  sure  he  could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front with Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back. With  a  jerk  the  cart  moved  off,  gathering  speed:  They  hurtled past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything over (cid:145) 533 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enormous footprints  behind  them;  the  more  he  thought  about  it,  the  more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix’s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it — They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Grin-gotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard Griphook  shout,  “No!”  but  there  was  no  braking:  They  zoomed through it. Water filled Harry’s eyes and mouth: He could not see or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were  all  thrown  out  of  it.  Harry  heard  the  cart  smash  into  pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor. “C-Cushioning Charm,” Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to Harry’s horror he saw that she was no longer Bella-trix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and com-pletely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again. They were realizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces. “The  Thief’s  Downfall!”  said  Griphook,  clambering  to  his  feet and looking back at the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water. “It washes away all enchantment, all  magical  concealment!  They  know  there  are  impostors  in  Grin-gotts, they have set off defenses against us!” Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he (cid:145) 534 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment: The Thief’s Downfall seemed to have lifted the Imperius Curse. “We need him,” said Griphook, “we cannot enter the vault with-out a Gringotts goblin. And we need the Clankers!” “Imperio!” Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain  to  wand.  Bogrod  submitted  once  more  to  his  will,  his  be-fuddled  expression  changing  to  one  of  polite  indifference,  as  Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools. “Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said Hermione, and she  pointed  Bellatrix’s  wand  at  the  waterfall  and  cried,  “Protego!” They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway. “Good thinking,” said Harry. “Lead the way, Griphook!” “How are we going to get out again?” Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog. “Let’s worry about that when we have to,” said Harry. He was trying to listen: He thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. “Griphook, how much farther?” “Not far, Harry Potter, not far . . .” And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared, but which still brought all of them to a halt. A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The beast’s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarcera-tion  under  the  ground;  its  eyes  were  milkily  pink;  both  rear  legs bore  heavy  cuffs  from  which  chains  led  to  enormous  pegs  driven (cid:145) 535 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway. “It is partially blind,” panted Griphook, “but even more savage for that. However, we have the means to control it. It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.” Ron  passed  the  bag  to  Griphook,  and  the  goblin  pulled  out  a number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a loud, ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed them out: Bogrod accepted his meekly. “You know what to do,” Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermi-one. “It will expect pain when it hears the noise: It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.” They  advanced  around  the  corner  again,  shaking  the  Clankers, and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the  inside  of  Harry’s  skull  seemed  to  vibrate  with  the  din.  The dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vi-cious slashes across its face, and guessed that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers. “Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry, who turned his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to  reveal  a  cavelike  opening  crammed  from  floor  to  ceiling  with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures — some with long spines, others with drooping wings — potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown. (cid:145) 536 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS “Search, fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. He had described Hufflepuff’s cup to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know what it looked like. He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a muffled clunk from behind them: The door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were plunged into total darkness. “No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!” said Griphook as Ron  gave  a  shout  of  surprise.  “Light  your  wands,  can’t  you?  And hurry, we have very little time!” “Lumos!” Harry  shone  his  lit  wand  around  the  vault:  Its  beam  fell  upon glittering  jewels;  he  saw  the  fake  sword  of  Gryffindor  lying  on  a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects sur-rounding them. “Harry, could this be — ? Aargh!” Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them. “It burned me!” moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers. “They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!” said Griphook. “Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless  —  and  if  you  continue  to  handle  the  treasure,  you  will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!” “Okay, don’t touch anything!” said Harry desperately, but even as he said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his (cid:145) 537 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX foot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal. “Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at Ron. “Just look around!” said Harry. “Remember, the cup’s small and gold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two handles — otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw’s symbol anywhere, the eagle —” They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously  on  the  spot.  It  was  impossible  not  to  brush  up  against anything;  Harry  sent  a  great  cascade  of  fake  Galleons  onto  the ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry’s wandlight passed over shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher  and  higher  he  raised  the  beam,  until  suddenly  it  found  an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble. “It’s there, it’s up there!” Ron and Hermione pointed their wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had be-longed to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle. “And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?” asked Ron. “Accio Cup!” cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her desperation  what  Griphook  had  told  them  during  their  planning sessions. “No use, no use!” snarled the goblin. “Then what do we do?” said Harry, glaring at the goblin. “If you want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more than — wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!” (cid:145) 538 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS Hermione  fumbled  inside  her  robes,  drew  out  the  beaded  bag, rummaged  for  a  few  seconds,  then  removed  the  shining  sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply. “If I can just poke the sword through a handle — but how am I going to get up there?” The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry’s face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder. They  were  truly  trapped  now:  There  was  no  way  out  except through the door, and a horde of goblins seemed to be approach-ing on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their faces. “Hermione,” said Harry as the clanking grew louder, “I’ve got to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it —” She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, “Levi-corpus.” Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas  burst  out  of  it  like  white-hot  bodies,  filling  the  cramped space. With screams of pain Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot treasure, they struggled and yelled as Harry thrust the sword through the handle of Hufflepuff’s cup, hooking it onto the blade. “Impervius!” screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from the burning metal. (cid:145) 539 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Her-mione were waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view. Harry seized Griphook’s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling. “Liberacorpus!” yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry’s hand. “Get it!” Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. “Where’s the sword? It had the cup on it!” The clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafen-ing — it was too late — “There!” It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of Harry’s hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of Harry’s reach. The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the sword’s blade, was flung into the air. The goblin still astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish  it,  even  while  countless  Hufflepuff  cups  burst  from  his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding   (cid:145) 540 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, and Hermione into the outer chamber. Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry’s shoulders the moment he could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, “Thieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!” He  vanished  into  the  midst  of  the  advancing  crowd,  all  of  whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question. Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was through. “Stupefy!” he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner. The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins: The wizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they had come,  and  inspiration,  or  madness,  came  to  Harry.  Pointing  his wand  at  the  thick  cuffs  chaining the  beast  to  the  floor,  he  yelled, “Relashio!” The cuffs broke open with loud bangs. “This  way!”  Harry  yelled,  and  still  shooting  Stunning  Spells  at the advancing goblins, he sprinted toward the blind dragon. “Harry — Harry — what are you doing?” cried Hermione. “Get up, climb up, come on —” The dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry’s foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back.   (cid:145) 541 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX The scales were hard as steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron climbed on behind them, and a second later the dragon became aware that it was untethered. With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as it  dived  toward  the  passage  opening,  while  the  pursuing  goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks. “We’ll never get out, it’s too big!” Hermione screamed, but the dragon  opened  its  mouth  and  belched  flame  again,  blasting  the tunnel,  whose  floors  and  ceiling  cracked  and  crumbled.  By  sheer force  the  dragon  clawed  and  fought  its  way  through.  Harry’s  eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crash-ing of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, “Defodio!” She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the  shrieking  and  clanking  goblins:  Harry  and  Ron  copied  her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage was  full  of  the  dragon’s  thrashing,  spiked  tail,  of  great  lumps  of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragon’s fire kept their progress clear —  (cid:145) 542 (cid:145) \\x0cGRINGOTTS And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon’s brute strength, they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings: Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, leav-ing  them  buckled  and  hanging  from  their  hinges,  as  it  staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky. (cid:145) 543 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E N T Y - S E V E N THE FINAL  HIDING PLACE  T here was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where it was going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a gray-and-green map, Harry’s overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast’s neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing. After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as  possible;  but  the  question  of  how  and  when  they  were  to  dis-mount  remained  rather  frightening.  He  had  no  idea  how  long (cid:145) 544 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FINAL  HIDING  PLACE dragons could fly without landing, nor how this particular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He glanced  around  constantly,  imagining  that  he  could  feel  his  scar prickling. . . . How  long  would  it  be  before  Voldemort  knew  that  they  had broken into the Lestranges’ vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts  notify  Bellatrix?  How  quickly  would  they  realize  what had  been  taken?  And  then,  when  they  discovered  that  the  golden cup  was  missing?  Voldemort  would  know,  at  last,  that  they  were hunting Horcruxes. . . . The  dragon  seemed  to  crave  cooler  and  fresher  air:  It  climbed steadily  until  they  were  flying  through  wisps  of  chilly  cloud,  and Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown, over roads and  rivers  winding  through  the  landscape  like  strips  of  matte  and glossy ribbon. “What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north. “No  idea,”  Harry  bellowed  back.  His  hands  were  numb  with cold  but  he  did  not  dare  attempt  to  shift  his  grip.  He  had  been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon headed for open sea; he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back? The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still the dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath (cid:145) 545 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon’s back. “Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of silence, “or are we losing height?” Harry  looked  down  and  saw  deep  green  mountains  and  lakes, coppery  in  the  sunset.  The  landscape  seemed  to  grow  larger  and more  detailed  as  he  squinted  over  the  side  of  the  dragon,  and  he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight. Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, hon-ing in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes. “I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called back to the others. “Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!” They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water. “NOW!” He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward  the  surface  of  the  lake;  the  drop  was  greater  than  he  had estimated  and  he  hit  the  water  hard,  plunging  like  a  stone  into  a freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione  had  fallen.  The  dragon  did not  seem  to  have  noticed  anything:  It  was  already  fifty  feet  away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant bank. Harry, Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The (cid:145) 546 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FINAL  HIDING  PLACE lake did not seem to be deep: Soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass. Hermione  collapsed,  coughing  and  shuddering.  Though  Harry could  have  happily  lain  down  and  slept,  he  staggered  to  his  feet, drew  out  his  wand,  and  started  casting  the  usual  protective  spells around them. When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their cloth-ing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought  from  Shell  Cottage  and  clean,  dry  robes  for  all  of  them. They changed and then gulped down the juice. “Well, on the upside,” said Ron finally, who was sitting watch-ing  the  skin  on  his  hands  regrow,  “we  got  the  Horcrux.  On  the downside —” “— no sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany  through  the  singed  hole  in  his  jeans  onto  the  angry  burn beneath. “No sword,” repeated Ron. “That double-crossing little scab . . .” Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had  just  taken  off  and  set  it  down  on  the  grass  in  front  of  them. Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice. “At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit weird hang-ing round our necks,” said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. (cid:145) 547 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN Hermione  looked  across  the  lake  to  the  far  bank,  where  the dragon was still drinking. “What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked. “Will it be all right?” “You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron. “It’s a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It’s us we need to worry about.” “What do you mean?” “Well, I don’t know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.” All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was dif-ficult to stop. Harry’s ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw. “What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally, hic-cuping  herself  back  to  seriousness.  “He’ll  know,  won’t  he?  You-Know-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes!” “Maybe  they’ll  be  too  scared  to  tell  him?”  said  Ron  hopefully. “Maybe they’ll cover up —” The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of Ron’s voice were extinguished: Pain cleaved Harry’s head like a sword stroke. He was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure. “What did you say to me?” His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear burned inside him. The one thing he had dreaded — but it could not be true, he could not see how . . . The goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his.  “Say it again!” murmured Voldemort. “Say it again!” (cid:145) 548 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FINAL  HIDING  PLACE “M-my Lord,” stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with ter-ror, “m-my Lord . . . we t-tried t-to st-stop them. . . . Im-impostors, my Lord . . . broke — broke into the — into the Lestranges’ v-vault. . . .” “Impostors?  What  impostors?  I  thought  Gringotts  had  ways  of revealing impostors? Who were they?” “It  was  .  .  .  it  was  .  .  .  the  P-Potter  b-boy  and  t-two  accom-plices. . . .” “And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him. “Tell me! What did they take?” “A . . . a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord . . .” The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s: He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, no-body had ever known: How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret? The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup — Alone  amongst  the  dead  he  stormed  up  and  down,  and  they passed before him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality — the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen: What if, what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of them? Was Dumbledore at  the  root  of  this?  Dumbledore,  who  had  always  suspected  him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was   (cid:145) 549 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy — But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumble-dore and of how many other worthless, nameless men: How could Lord  Voldemort  not  have  known,  if  he,  himself,  most  important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated? True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had thought that was because he had no body to feel, being less than ghost. . . . No, surely, the rest were safe. . . . The other Hor-cruxes must be intact. . . . But  he  must  know,  he  must  be  sure.  .  .  .  He  paced  the  room, kicking  aside  the  goblin’s  corpse  as  he  passed,  and  the  pictures blurred  and  burned  in  his  boiling  brain:  the  lake,  the  shack,  and Hogwarts — A  modicum  of  calm  cooled  his  rage  now:  How  could  the  boy know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever  known  him  to  be  related  to  the  Gaunts,  he  had  hidden  the connection,  the  killings  had  never  been  traced  to  him:  The  ring, surely, was safe. And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate  its  protection?  The  idea  of  the  locket  being  stolen  was absurd. . . . As  for  the  school:  He  alone  knew  where  in  Hogwarts  he  had stowed  the  Horcrux,  because  he  alone  had  plumbed  the  deepest secrets of that place. . . . And there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his protection. . . . (cid:145) 550 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FINAL  HIDING  PLACE But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding places, he must redouble protection around each of his Hor-cruxes. . . . A job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone . . . Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease  flickered  inside  him.  Dumbledore  had  known  his  middle name. . . . Dumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts. . . . Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would go first. . . . The lake, surely impossible . . . though was there a slight possibil-ity that Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the orphanage. And Hogwarts . . . but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe; it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detec-tion, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle. . . . To tell Snape why the boy might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy: Didn’t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust? He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him: He would not be parted from the snake anymore . . . and he strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark gar-den where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow. . . . Harry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the pres-ent: He was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron  and  Hermione  were  looking  down  at  him.  Judging  by  their worried looks, and by the continued pounding of his scar, his sud-den excursion into Voldemort’s mind had not passed unnoticed. He (cid:145) 551 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the failing sun. “He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low after Vol-demort’s high screams. “He knows, and he’s going to check where the others are, and the last one,” he was already on his feet, “is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew it.” “What?” Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried. “But what did you see? How do you know?” “I saw him find out about the cup, I — I was in his head, he’s” — Harry remembered the killings — “he’s seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check the  others  are  safe,  the  ring  first.  He  thinks  the  Hogwarts  one  is safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting  in,  I  think  he’ll  check  that  one  last,  but  he  could  still  be there within hours —” “Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron, now scram-bling to his feet too. about exactly where it is —” “No,  he  was  concentrating  on  warning  Snape,  he  didn’t  think “Wait, wait!” cried Hermione as Ron caught up the Horcrux and Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. “We can’t just go, we haven’t got a plan, we need to —” “We need to get going,” said Harry firmly. He had been hop-ing to sleep, looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now. “Can you imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn’t safe enough?” (cid:145) 552 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FINAL  HIDING  PLACE “But how are we going to get in?” “We’ll go to Hogsmeade,” said Harry, “and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the school’s like. Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time.” “But we don’t really fit —” “It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet.” The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water: The dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against  the  rapidly  darkening  sky,  until  it  vanished  over  a  nearby mountain. Then Hermione walked forward and took her place be-tween  the  other  two.  Harry  pulled  the  Cloak  down  as  far  as  it would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness. (cid:145) 553 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E N T Y - E I G H T THE MISSING MIRROR     H arry’s  feet  touched  road.  He  saw  the  achingly  familiar Hogsmeade  High  Street:  dark  shop  fronts,  and  the  out-line  of  black  mountains  beyond  the  village,  and  the  curve  in  the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the heart he  remembered,  with  piercing  accuracy,  how  he  had  landed  here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore; all this in a second, upon landing — and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron’s and Hermione’s arms, it happened. The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort’s when he  had  realized  the  cup  had  been  stolen:  It  tore  at  every  nerve  in Harry’s body, and he knew immediately that their appearance had caused it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the street, their wands aloft. Harry  seized  Ron’s  wrist  as  he  raised  his  wand;  there  were  too (cid:145) 554 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MISSING MIRROR many  of  them  to  Stun:  Even  attempting it would give away their position. One of the Death Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains. “Accio Cloak!” roared one of the Death Eaters. Harry  seized  its  folds,  but  it  made  no  attempt  to  escape:  The Summoning Charm had not worked on it. “Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm, and then to his fellows, “Spread out. He’s here.” Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron, and Her-mione  backed  as  quickly  as  possible  down  the  nearest  side  street, and  the  Death  Eaters  missed  them  by  inches.  They  waited  in  the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of  light  flying  along  the  street  from  the  Death  Eaters’  searching wands. “Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate now!” “Great  idea,”  said  Ron,  but  before  Harry  could  reply  a  Death Eater shouted, find you!” “We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting away! We’ll “They  were  ready  for  us,”  whispered  Harry.  “They  set  up  that spell to tell them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap us —” “What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let ’em have free rein, they’d find him quick enough!” “The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his —” “— an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!” There  were  noises  of  agreement.  Dread  filled  Harry:  To  repel (cid:145) 555 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT dementors  they  would  have  to  produce  Patronuses,  which  would give them away immediately. “We’re  going  to  have  to  try  to  Disapparate,  Harry!”  Hermione whispered. Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot. The  air  through  which  they  needed  to  move  seemed  to  have become  solid:  They  could  not  Disapparate;  the  Death  Eaters  had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry’s flesh. He, Ron, and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall, trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rot-ting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of  it:  They  seemed  to  be  coming  more  quickly  now,  taking  those dragging,  rattling  breaths  he  detested,  tasting  despair  on  the  air, closing in — He raised his wand: He could not, would not, suffer the Demen-tor’s Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermi-one that he thought as he whispered, “Expecto Patronum!” The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The dementors scattered  and  there  was  a  triumphant  yell  from  somewhere  out  of sight. “It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag! The dementors had retreated, the stars were popping out again, (cid:145) 556 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MISSING MIRROR and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but be-fore Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-hand side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said, “Potter, in here, quick!” He obeyed without hesitation: The three of them hurtled through the open doorway. “Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a tall figure, passing  them  on  his  way  into  the  street  and  slamming  the  door behind him. Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust-strewn bar of the Hog’s Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase that they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened onto a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of vacant sweetness. Shouts  reached  them  from  the  street  below.  Still  wearing  the Invisibility Cloak, they crept toward the grimy window and looked down.  Their  savior,  whom  Harry  now  recognized  as  the  Hog’s Head’s barman, was the only person not wearing a hood. “So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. “So what?  You  send  dementors  down  my  street,  I’ll  send  a  Patronus back at ’em! I’m not having ’em near me, I’ve told you that, I’m not having it!” “That  wasn’t  your  Patronus!”  said  a  Death  Eater.  “That  was  a stag, it was Potter’s!” idiot — Expecto Patronum!” “Stag!” roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. “Stag! You (cid:145) 557 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT Something  huge  and  horned  erupted  from  the  wand:  Head down, it charged toward the High Street and out of sight. “That’s  not  what  I  saw  —”  said  the  Death  Eater,  though  with less certainty. “Curfew’s  been  broken,  you  heard  the  noise,”  one  of  his  com-panions  told  the  barman.  “Someone  was  out  in  the  street  against regulations —” “If  I  want  to  put  my  cat  out,  I  will,  and  be  damned  to  your curfew!” “You set off the Caterwauling Charm?” “What  if  I  did?  Going  to  cart  me  off  to  Azkaban?  Kill  me  for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks and summoned him. He’s not going to like being called here for me and my old cat, is he, now?” “Don’t you worry about us,” said one of the Death Eaters, “worry about yourself, breaking curfew!” “And where will you lot traffick potions and poisons when my pub’s closed down? What’ll happen to your little sidelines then?” “Are you threatening — ?” “I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t it?” “I still say I saw a stag Patronus!” shouted the first Death Eater. “Stag?” roared the barman. “It’s a goat, idiot!” “All  right,  we  made  a  mistake,”  said  the  second  Death  Eater. “Break curfew again and we won’t be so lenient!” The Death Eaters strode back toward the High Street. Hermi-one  moaned  with  relief,  wove  out  from  under  the  Cloak,  and  sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains tight shut, then  pulled  the  Cloak  off  himself  and  Ron.  They  could  hear  the (cid:145) 558 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MISSING MIRROR barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs. Harry’s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl. The barman entered the room. “You bloody fools,” he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. “What were you thinking, coming here?” “Thank you,” said Harry. “We can’t thank you enough. You saved our lives.” The barman grunted. Harry approached him, looking up into the face, trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair and beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a pierc-ing, brilliant blue. “It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror.” There was silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other. “You sent Dobby.” The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. “Thought he’d be with you. Where’ve you left him?” “He’s dead,” said Harry. “Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.” The barman’s face was impassive. After a few moments he said, “I’m sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.” He turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his wand, not look-ing at any of them. “You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back. He neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light the fire. “How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across to Sirius’s mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before. (cid:145) 559 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT “Bought  it  from  Dung  ’bout  a  year  ago,”  said  Aberforth.  “Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.” Ron gasped. “The silver doe!” he said excitedly. “Was that you too?” “What are you talking about?” said Aberforth. “Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!” “Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven’t I just proved my Patronus is a goat?” “Oh,” said Ron. “Yeah . . . well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble. “I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, re-appearing  moments  later  with  a  large  loaf  of  bread,  some  cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the fire, the clink of goblets, and the sound of chewing. “Right then,” said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill, and Harry  and  Ron  sat  slumped  dozily  in  their  chairs.  “We  need  to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can’t be done by night, you  heard  what  happens  if  anyone  moves  outdoors  during  dark-ness:  Caterwauling  Charm’s  set  off,  they’ll  be  onto  you  like  bow-truckles on doxy eggs. I don’t reckon I’ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you’ll be able to Disap-parate there. Might see Hagrid. He’s been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.” “We’re not leaving,” said Harry. “We need to get into Hogwarts.” “Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth. (cid:145) 560 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MISSING MIRROR “We’ve got to,” said Harry. “What you’ve got to do,” said Aberforth, leaning forward, “is to get as far from here as you can.” “You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve got to get into the castle. Dumbledore — I mean, your brother — wanted us —” The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth’s glasses momen-tarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog. “My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said Aberforth, “and people  had  a  habit  of  getting  hurt  while  he  was  carrying  out  his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He’s gone  where  none  of  this  can  hurt  him,  and  you  don’t  owe  him anything.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry again. “Oh, don’t I?” said Aberforth quietly. “You don’t think I under-stood my own brother? Think you knew Albus better than I did?” “I didn’t mean that,” said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. “It’s . . . he left me a job.” “Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you’d expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?” Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. “I-it’s not easy, no,” said Harry. “But I’ve got to —” “ ‘Got  to’?  Why  ‘got  to’?  He’s  dead,  isn’t  he?”  said  Aberforth roughly. “Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!” “I can’t.” (cid:145) 561 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT “Why not?” “I —” Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. “But you’re fighting too, you’re in the Order of the Phoenix —” “I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending dif-ferent’s kidding themselves. It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.” He jerked a thumb at Ron and Her-mione. “They’ll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they’ve been working with you.” “I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a job —” “Give it to someone else!” “I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all —” “Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?” Harry wanted with all his heart to say “Yes,” but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips. Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. “I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother’s knee. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus . . . he was a natural.” The old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece.  It  was,  now  Harry  looked  around  properly,  the  only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumble-dore, nor of anyone else. “Mr. Dumbledore?” said Hermione rather timidly. “Is that your sister? Ariana?”  (cid:145) 562 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MISSING MIRROR “Yes,”  said  Aberforth  tersely.  “Been  reading  Rita  Skeeter,  have you, missy?” Hermione. Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red. “Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said Harry, trying to spare “That  old  berk,”  muttered  Aberforth,  taking  another  swig  of mead. “Thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every orifice, he  did.  Well,  so  did  plenty  of  people,  you  three  included,  by  the looks of it.” Harry  kept  quiet.  He  did  not  want  to  express  the  doubts  and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had decided  to  continue  along  the  winding,  dangerous  path  indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want to hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth’s gaze, which was so strikingly like his brother’s: The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and de-spised him for it. “Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,” said Her-mione in a low voice. “Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing, how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he’d left ’em well alone.” “What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly.  (cid:145) 563 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT “Never you mind,” said Aberforth. “But  that’s  a  really  serious  thing  to  say!”  said  Hermione.  “Are you — are you talking about your sister?” Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech. “When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by three  Muggle  boys.  They’d  seen  her  doing  magic,  spying  through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch  or  wizard  can  at  that  age.  What  they  saw  scared  them,  I expect.  They  forced  their  way  through  the  hedge,  and  when  she couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.” Hermione’s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain. “It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless. “And my father went after the bastards that did it,” said Aber-forth, “and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he’d done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she’d have been locked up in St. Mungo’s for good. They’d have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn’t keep it in any longer. “We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about (cid:145) 564 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MISSING MIRROR she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy. “I was her favorite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth’s wrinkles and tangled beard. “Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading  his  books  and  counting  his  prizes,  keeping  up  with  his correspondence with ‘the most notable magical names of the day,’ ” Aberforth  sneered.  “He  didn’t  want  to  be  bothered  with  her.  She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn’t do it for my mother, I could get her to calm down when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats. “Then, when she was fourteen . . . See, I wasn’t there,” said Ab-erforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and . . . it was an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother was killed.” Harry  felt  a  horrible  mixture  of  pity  and  repulsion;  he  did  not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry won-dered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it. “So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the fam-ily. Ha!” Aberforth spat into the fire. “I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about school, I’d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my education and he’d take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there’s no prizes for looking after your half-mad (cid:145) 565 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.” And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face. “Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an  equal to talk to, someone  just  as  bright  and  talented  as  he  was.  And  looking  after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order, and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl got neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good? “But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It was nearly time  for  me  to  go  back  to  Hogwarts,  so  I  told  ’em,  both  of  ’em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,” and Aberforth looked down at Harry, and it took little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. “I told him, you’d better give it up now. You can’t move her, she’s in no fit state, you can’t take her with you, wherever it is you’re planning to go, when you’re making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a follow-ing. He didn’t like that,” said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded  by  the  firelight  on  the  lenses  of  his  glasses:  They  shone white and blind again. “Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother. . . . Didn’t I understand, my poor sister wouldn’t have to be hidden once they’d changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place? “And there was an argument . . . and I pulled out my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother’s best friend — and Albus was trying to stop him, and then (cid:145) 566 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MISSING MIRROR all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn’t stand it —” The color was draining from Aberforth’s face as though he had suffered a mortal wound. “— and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know what she was doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could have been any of us — and she was dead.” His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest  chair.  Hermione’s  face  was  wet  with  tears,  and  Ron  was almost  as  pale  as  Aberforth.  Harry  felt  nothing  but  revulsion:  He wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean of it. “I’m so . . . I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered. “Gone,” croaked Aberforth. “Gone forever.” He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat. “ ’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the —” “He was never free,” said Harry. “I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth. “Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, plead-ing with someone who wasn’t there. ‘Don’t hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.’ ” Ron  and  Hermione  were  staring  at  Harry.  He  had  never  gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake: The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly. (cid:145) 567 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT “He  thought  he  was  back  there  with  you  and  Grindelwald,  I know he did,” said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whimpering, pleading.  “He  thought  he  was  watching  Grindelwald  hurting  you and Ariana. . . . It was torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you wouldn’t say he was free.” Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined  hands.  After  a  long  pause  he  said,  “How  can  you  be  sure, Potter, that my brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like my little sister?” A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart. “I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione. “Why  didn’t  he  tell  him  to  hide,  then?”  shot  back  Aberforth. “Why  didn’t  he  say  to  him,  ‘Take  care  of  yourself,  here’s  how  to survive’?” “Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes you’ve  got  to  think  about  more  than  your  own  safety!  Sometimes you’ve got to think about the greater good! This is war!” “You’re seventeen, boy!” “I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given up!” “Who says I’ve given up?” “ ‘The Order of the Phoenix is finished,’ ” Harry repeated. “ ‘You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves.’ ” “I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!” “No, it isn’t,” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going to   (cid:145) 568 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  MISSING MIRROR keep going until I succeed — or I die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve known it for years.” He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely scowled. “We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If you can’t help us, we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us — well, now would be a great time to mention it.” Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that were so extraordinarily like his brother’s. At last he cleared his  throat,  got  to  his  feet,  walked  around  the  little  table,  and  ap-proached the portrait of Ariana. “You know what to do,” he said. She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, out of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to  be  a  long  tunnel  painted  behind  her.  They  watched  her  slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness. “Er — what — ?” began Ron. “There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You must know they’ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, de-mentors  all  around  the  boundary  walls,  regular  patrols  inside  the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies . . . well, that’s your lookout, isn’t it? You say you’re prepared to die.” “But what . . . ?” said Hermione, frowning at Ariana’s picture. A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger   (cid:145) 569 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone  taller  than  she  was,  who  was  limping  along,  looking  ex-cited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen it: He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were ripped and  torn.  Larger  and  larger  the  two  figures  grew,  until  only  their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swung forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tun-nel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and yelled, “I knew you’d come! I knew it, Harry!” (cid:145) 570 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T W E N T Y - N I N E THE LOST DIADEM     N eville — what the — how — ?” But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of delight was hugging them too. The longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, “I knew you’d come! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time!” “Neville, what’s happened to you?” “What? This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. “This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Shall we get go-ing then? Oh,” he turned to Aberforth, “Ab, there might be a couple more people on the way.” “Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What d’you   (cid:145) 571 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There’s a curfew and a Cater-wauling Charm on the whole village!” “I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,” said Neville. “Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.” Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth. “I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve saved our lives twice.” “Look after ’em, then,” said Aberforth gruffly. “I might not be able to save ’em a third time.” Harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Ariana’s portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the other side: It looked as though the passageway had been there for years. Brass  lamps  hung  from  the  walls  and  the  earthy  floor  was  worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall. “How long’s this been here?” Ron asked as they set off. “It isn’t on the Marauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of school?” “They  sealed  off  all  of  those  before  the  start  of  the  year,”  said Neville.  “There’s  no  chance  of  getting  through  any  of  them  now, not with curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and demen-tors  waiting  at  the  exits.”  He  started  walking  backward,  beaming, drinking them in. “Never mind that stuff. . . . Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It’s everywhere, everyone’s talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!” “Yeah, it’s true,” said Harry. (cid:145) 572 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LOST DIADEM Neville laughed gleefully. “What did you do with the dragon?” “Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keep-ing it as a pet —” “Don’t exaggerate, Ron —” “But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve just  been  on  the  run,  Harry,  but I  don’t  think  so.  I  think  you’ve been up to something.” “You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’t heard anything.” “It’s been . . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville, the smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?” “Those two Death Eaters who teach here?” “They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.” “Like Umbridge?” “Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all sup-posed  to  refer  us  to  the  Carrows  if  we  do  anything  wrong.  They don’t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do. “Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the  Dark  Arts,  except  now  it’s  just  the  Dark  Arts.  We’re  sup-posed  to  practice  the  Cruciatus  Curse  on  people  who’ve  earned detentions —” “What?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the passage. “Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a (cid:145) 573 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in anything, I expect. “Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is com-pulsory  for  everyone.  We’ve  all  got  to  listen  to  her  explain  how Muggles  are  like  animals,  stupid  and  dirty,  and  how  they  drove wizards  into  hiding  by  being  vicious  toward  them,  and  how  the natural  order  is  being  reestablished.  I  got  this  one,”  he  indicated another slash to his face, “for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.” “Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place for get-ting a smart mouth.” “You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.” “But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said Ron, wincing slightly  as  they  passed  a  lamp  and  Neville’s  injuries  were  thrown into even greater relief. Neville shrugged. “Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much pure blood, so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually kill us.” Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them. “The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives  on  the  outside  are  giving  trouble.  They  get  taken  hos-tage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The Quibbler,  so  they  dragged  Luna  off  the train on  the way  back for Christmas.” (cid:145) 574 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LOST DIADEM “Neville, she’s all right, we’ve seen her —” “Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.” From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons that Dumbledore’s Army had used to send one another messages. “These  have  been  great,”  said  Neville,  beaming  at  Hermione. “The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls:  Dumbledore’s  Army,  Still  Recruiting,  stuff  like  that.  Snape hated it.” “You used to?” said Harry, who had noticed the past tense. “Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said Neville. “We lost  Luna  at  Christmas,  and  Ginny  never  came  back  after  Easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they’d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.” “No  kidding,”  muttered  Ron,  as  the  passage  began  to  slope upward. “Yeah,  well,  I  couldn’t  ask  people  to  go  through  what  Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.” “They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. “Yeah,”  said  Neville,  panting  a  little  now,  because  the  passage was  climbing  so  steeply,  “well,  you  can  see  their  thinking.  It  had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, (cid:145) 575 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE I s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was,” he faced them,  and  Harry  was  astonished  to see that he was grinning, “they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they  didn’t  need  to  send  anyone  particularly  powerful.  Anyway,” Neville laughed, “Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and Gran’s on the run. She sent me a letter,” he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, “telling me she was proud of me, that I’m my parents’ son, and to keep it up.” “Cool,” said Ron. “Yeah,” said Neville happily. “Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear.” “But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t — aren’t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?” “ ’Course,” said Neville. “You’ll see. We’re here.” They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one  hidden  behind  Ariana’s  portrait.  Neville  pushed  it  open  and climbed  through.  As  Harry  followed,  he  heard  Neville  call  out  to unseen people: “Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?” As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were several  screams  and  yells:  “HARRY!”  “It’s  Potter,  it’s  POTTER!” “Ron!” “Hermione!” He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many  faces.  The  next  moment,  he,  Ron,  and  Hermione  were  en-gulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands (cid:145) 576 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LOST DIADEM shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people: They might just have won a Quidditch final. “Okay, okay, calm down!” Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry was able to take in their surroundings. He  did  not  recognize  the  room  at  all.  It  was  enormous,  and looked  rather  like  the  interior  of  a  particularly  sumptuous  tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship’s cabin. Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in  bright  tapestry  hangings:  Harry  saw  the  gold  Gryffindor  lion, emblazoned  on  scarlet;  the  black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden-cased wireless. “Where are we?” “Room of Requirement, of course!” said Neville. “Surpassed it-self, hasn’t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn’t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryf-findor hangings. But it’s expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.” “And  the  Carrows  can’t  get  in?”  asked  Harry,  looking  around for the door. “No,”  said  Seamus  Finnigan,  whom  Harry  had  not  recognized until he spoke: Seamus’s face was bruised and puffy. “It’s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can’t get at us, the door won’t open. It’s all down to Neville. He really gets this room. (cid:145) 577 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE You’ve got to ask it for exactly what you need — like, ‘I don’t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in’ — and it’ll do it for you! You’ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes! Neville’s the man!” “It’s  quite  straightforward,  really,”  said  Neville  modestly.  “I’d been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that’s when the passage to the Hog’s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He’s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that’s the one thing the room doesn’t really do.” “Yeah, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,” said Ron to general astonishment. “So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said Sea-mus, “and it just makes more hammocks every time we need them, and  it  even  sprouted  a  pretty  good  bathroom  once  girls  started turning up —” “—  and  thought  they’d  quite  like  to  wash,  yes,”  supplied  Lav-ender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner. “Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie. “There’ve been  so  many  rumors,  we’ve  been  trying  to  keep  up  with  you  on Potterwatch.”  He  pointed  at  the  wireless.  “You  didn’t  break  into Gringotts?” “They did!” said Neville. “And the dragon’s true too!” There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow.  (cid:145) 578 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LOST DIADEM “What were you after?” asked Seamus eagerly. Before  any  of  them  could  parry  the  question  with  one  of  their own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he  turned  his  back  hastily  on  the  curious  and  delighted  faces,  the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ru-ined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort’s scream of fury vibrated inside his head. With  an  enormous  effort  he  pulled  out  of  Voldemort’s  mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Require-ment, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up. “Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying. “Want to sit down? I expect you’re tired, aren’t — ?” “No,” said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast: If Volde-mort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance. “We need to get going,” he said, and their expressions told him that they understood. the plan?” “What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked Seamus. “What’s “Plan?”  repeated  Harry.  He  was  exercising  all  his  willpower  to prevent himself succumbing again to Voldemort’s rage: His scar was still burning. “Well, there’s something we — Ron, Hermione, and I — need to do, and then we’ll get out of here.” Nobody  was  laughing  or  whooping  anymore.  Neville  looked confused.  “What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?” (cid:145) 579 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE “We  haven’t  come  back  to  stay,”  said  Harry,  rubbing  his  scar, trying to soothe the pain. “There’s something important we need to do —” “What is it?” “I — I can’t tell you.” There  was  a  ripple  of  muttering  at  this:  Neville’s  brows contracted. “Why can’t you tell us? It’s something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?” “Well, yeah —” “Then we’ll help you.” The other members of Dumbledore’s Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, others solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action. “You don’t understand.” Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. “We — we can’t tell you. We’ve got to do it — alone.” “Why?” asked Neville. “Because . . .” In his desperation to start looking for the miss-ing Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts. His scar was still searing. “Dumbledore  left  the  three  of  us  a  job,”  he  said  carefully,  “and we weren’t supposed to tell — I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.” “We’re his army,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army. We were all in it together, we’ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own —”  (cid:145) 580 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LOST DIADEM “It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ron. “I never said it had, but I don’t see why you can’t trust us. Every-one  in  this  room’s  been  fighting  and  they’ve  been  driven  in  here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here’s proven they’re loyal to Dumbledore — loyal to you.” “Look,”  Harry  began,  without  knowing  what  he  was  going  to say, but it did not matter: The tunnel door had just opened behind him. “We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be here!” ran to hug his best friend. It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and “Hi, everyone!” said Luna happily. “Oh, it’s great to be back!” “Luna,” said Harry distractedly, “what are you doing here? How did you — ?” “I  sent  for  her,”  said  Neville,  holding  up  the  fake  Galleon.  “I promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I’d let them know. We  all  thought  that  if  you  came  back,  it  would  mean  revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.” “Of  course  that’s  what  it  means,”  said  Luna  brightly.  “Isn’t  it, Harry? We’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?” “Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m sorry, but that’s not what we came back for. There’s something we’ve got to do, and then —” “You’re  going  to  leave  us  in  this  mess?”  demanded  Michael Corner. “No!” said Ron. “What we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who —”  (cid:145) 581 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE “Then let us help!” said Neville angrily. “We want to be a part of it!” There  was  another  noise  behind  them,  and  Harry  turned.  His heart seemed to fail: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, or had never fully ap-preciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her. “Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting. “He wants a kip, and his bar’s turned into a railway station.” Harry’s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry’s old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at him. “I got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake Galleon, and she walked over to sit beside Michael Corner. “So what’s the plan, Harry?” said George. “There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden ap-pearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely. “Just  going  to  make  it  up  as  we  go  along,  are  we?  My  favorite kind,” said Fred. “You’ve got to stop this!” Harry told Neville. “What did you call them all back for? This is insane —” “We’re fighting, aren’t we?” said Dean, taking out his fake Gal-leon. “The message said Harry was back, and we were going to fight! I’ll have to get a wand, though —” “You haven’t got a wand — ?” began Seamus. Ron turned suddenly to Harry.  (cid:145) 582 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LOST DIADEM “Why can’t they help?” “What?” “They can help.” He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione, who stood between them, “We don’t know where it is. We’ve got to find it fast. We don’t have to tell them it’s a Horcrux.” Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, “I think Ron’s right. We don’t even know what we’re looking for, we need them.” And when Harry looked unconvinced, “You don’t have to do everything alone, Harry.” Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. Dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus . . . he was a natural. . . . Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower . . . “All right,” he said quietly to the other two. “Okay,” he called to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them looked alert, excited. “There’s  something  we  need  to  find,”  Harry  said.  “Some-thing — something that’ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It’s here  at  Hogwarts,  but  we  don’t  know  where.  It  might  have  be-longed  to  Ravenclaw.  Has  anyone  heard  of  an  object  like  that? Has  anyone  ever  come  across  something  with  her  eagle  on  it,  for instance?” He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to   (cid:145) 583 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny’s chair. “Well,  there’s  her  lost  diadem.  I  told  you  about  it,  remember, Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy’s trying to dupli-cate it.” “Yeah, but the lost diadem,” said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, “is lost, Luna. That’s sort of the point.” “When was it lost?” asked Harry. “Centuries ago, they say,” said Cho, and Harry’s heart sank. “Pro-fessor  Flitwick  says  the  diadem  vanished  with  Ravenclaw  herself. People  have  looked,  but,”  she  appealed  to  her  fellow  Ravenclaws, “nobody’s ever found a trace of it, have they?” They all shook their heads. “Sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ron. “It’s a kind of crown,” said Terry Boot. “Ravenclaw’s was supposed to have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.” “Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons —” But Harry cut across Luna. “And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?” They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Her-mione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An object  that  had  been  lost  this  long,  and  apparently  without  trace, did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle. . . . Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again. “If you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to look like, I could  take  you  up  to  our  common  room  and  show  you,  Harry? Ravenclaw’s wearing it in her statue.” Harry’s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Require-(cid:145) 584 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LOST DIADEM ment swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort  was  flying  again,  whether  to  the  underground  lake  or here, to the castle, he did not know: Either way, there was hardly any time left. “He’s on the move,” he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at them. “Listen, I know it’s not much of a lead, but I’m going to go and look at this statue, at least find out  what  the  diadem  looks  like.  Wait  for  me  here  and  keep,  you know — the other one — safe.” Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, “No, Luna will take Harry, won’t you, Luna?” “Oooh, yes, I’d like to,” said Luna happily, and Cho sat down again, looking disappointed. “How do we get out?” Harry asked Neville. “Over here.” He  led  Harry  and  Luna  to  a  corner,  where  a  small  cupboard opened onto a steep staircase. “It  comes  out  somewhere  different  every  day,  so  they’ve  never been able to find it,” he said. “Only trouble is, we never know exactly where  we’re  going  to  end  up  when  we  go  out.  Be  careful,  Harry, they’re always patrolling the corridors at night.” “No problem,” said Harry. “See you in a bit.” He  and  Luna  hurried  up  the  staircase,  which  was  long,  lit  by torches,  and  turned  corners  in  unexpected  places.  At  last  they reached what appeared to be solid wall. “Get under here,” Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push. (cid:145) 585 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were stand-ing in a dark corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his nose he searched, and located his and Luna’s dots at last. “We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch mov-ing away from them, a corridor ahead. “Come on, this way.” They crept off. Harry  had  prowled  the  castle  at  night  many  times  before,  but never  had  his  heart  hammered  this  fast,  never  had  so  much  de-pended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares of  moonlight  upon  the  floor,  past  suits  of  armor  whose  helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which  who  knew  what  lurked,  Harry  and  Luna  walked,  checking the  Marauder’s  Map  whenever  light  permitted,  twice  pausing  to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach. “This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase. They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. Luna  reached  out  a  pale  hand,  which  looked  eerie  floating  in midair, unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of (cid:145) 586 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  LOST DIADEM the eagle opened, but instead of a bird’s call, a soft, musical voice said, “Which came first, the phoenix or the flame?” “Hmm  .  .  .  What  do  you  think,  Harry?”  said  Luna,  looking thoughtful. “What? Isn’t there just a password?” “Oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna. “What if you get it wrong?” “Well,  you  have  to  wait  for  somebody  who  gets  it  right,”  said Luna. “That way you learn, you see?” “Yeah . . . Trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.” “No,  I  see  what  you  mean,”  said  Luna  seriously.  “Well  then,  I think the answer is that a circle has no beginning.” “Well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung open. The  deserted  Ravenclaw  common  room  was  a  wide,  circular room,  airier  than  any  Harry  had  ever  seen  at  Hogwarts.  Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks: By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view  of  the  surrounding  mountains.  The  ceiling  was  domed  and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. There  were  tables,  chairs,  and  bookcases,  and  in  a  niche  opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble. Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna’s house. The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face,  beautiful  yet  slightly  intimidating.  A  delicate-looking  circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. It was not un-like the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words (cid:145) 587 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw’s plinth to read them. “ ‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’ ” “Which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a cackling voice. Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm. (cid:145) 588 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T H I R T Y  THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE  T he  moment  her  finger  touched  the  Mark,  Harry’s  scar burned savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing around him and there was triumph in his heart — They have the boy. A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: Disoriented, he  raised  his  wand,  but  the  witch  before  him  was  already  falling forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled. “I’ve  never  Stunned  anyone  except  in  our  D.A.  lessons,”  said Luna, sounding mildly interested. “That was noisier than I thought it would be.” And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door lead-ing to the dormitories: Luna’s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above. (cid:145) 589 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY “Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!” Luna’s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and she  let  the  Cloak  fall  back  over  them  as  the  door  opened  and  a stream  of  Ravenclaws,  all  in  their  nightclothes,  flooded  into  the common room. There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled in around her, a  savage  beast  that  might  wake  at  any  moment  and  attack  them. Then  one  brave  little  first-year  darted  up  to  her  and  prodded  her backside with his big toe. “I think she might be dead!” he shouted with delight. “Oh, look,” whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. “They’re pleased!” “Yeah . . . great . . .” Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort’s mind. . . . He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave. . . . He had chosen to make sure of the locket before coming . . . but that would not take him long. . . . There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued  from  the  eagle  door  knocker:  “Where  do  Vanished  objects go?” “I  dunno,  do  I?  Shut  it!”  snarled  an  uncouth  voice  that  Harry knew was that of the Carrow brother, Amycus. “Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got him? Open the door!” The  Ravenclaws  were  whispering  amongst  themselves,  terrified. Then, without warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the door. “ALECTO!  If  he  comes,  and  we  haven’t  got  Potter  —  d’you want to go the same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!” Amycus (cid:145) 590 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SACKING  OF SEVERUS  SNAPE bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened  began  scampering  back  up  the  staircase  to  their  beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything  else,  a  second,  most  familiar  voice  rang  out  beyond  the door. “May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?” “Trying  —  to  get  —  through  this  damned  —  door!”  shouted Amycus. “Go and get Flitwick! Get him to open it, now!” “But  isn’t  your  sister  in  there?”  asked  Professor  McGonagall. “Didn’t  Professor  Flitwick  let  her  in  earlier  this  evening,  at  your urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you needn’t wake up half the castle.” “She ain’t answering, you old besom! You open it! Garn! Do it, now! “Certainly, if you wish it,” said Professor McGonagall, with aw-ful coldness. There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again, “Where do Vanished objects go?” “Into  nonbeing,  which  is  to  say,  everything,”  replied  Professor McGonagall. swung open. “Nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker, and the door The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs  as  Amycus  burst  over  the  threshold,  brandishing  his  wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He let out a yell of fury and fear. (cid:145) 591 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY “What’ve they done, the little whelps?” he screamed. “I’ll Cruci-ate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it — and what’s the Dark Lord going to say?” he shrieked, standing over his sister and smack-ing himself on the forehead with his fist. “We haven’t got him, and they’ve gorn and killed her!” “She’s  only  Stunned,”  said  Professor  McGonagall  impatiently, who  had  stooped  down  to  examine  Alecto. “She’ll be perfectly all right.” “No  she  bludgering  well  won’t!”  bellowed  Amycus.  “Not  after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! She’s gorn and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we’ve got Potter!” “ ‘Got  Potter’?”  said  Professor  McGonagall  sharply.  “What  do you mean, ‘got Potter’?” “He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him if we caught him!” “Why  would  Harry  Potter  try  to  get  inside  Ravenclaw  Tower? Potter belongs in my House!” Beneath  the  disbelief  and  anger,  Harry  heard  a  little  strain  of pride  in  her  voice,  and  affection  for  Minerva  McGonagall  gushed up inside him. “We  was  told  he  might  come  in  here!”  said  Carrow.  “I  dunno why, do I?” Professor  McGonagall  stood  up  and  her  beady  eyes  swept  the room. Twice they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood. “We can push it off on the kids,” said Amycus, his piglike face suddenly  crafty.  “Yeah,  that’s  what  we’ll  do.  We’ll  say  Alecto  was ambushed by the kids, them kids up there” — he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories — “and we’ll say they forced (cid:145) 592 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SACKING  OF SEVERUS  SNAPE her to press her Mark, and that’s why he got a false alarm. . . . He can punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what’s the difference?” “Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and coward-ice,” said Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, “a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.” “Excuse me?” Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Profes-sor McGonagall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat. “It’s not a case of what you’ll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time’s over. It’s us what’s in charge here now, and you’ll back me up or you’ll pay the price.” And he spat in her face. Harry  pulled  the  Cloak  off  himself,  raised  his  wand,  and  said, “You shouldn’t have done that.” As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!” The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. “I  see  what  Bellatrix  meant,”  said  Harry,  the  blood  thundering through his brain, “you need to really mean it.” “Potter!”  whispered  Professor  McGonagall,  clutching  her  heart. “Potter — you’re here! What — ? How — ?” She struggled to pull herself together. “Potter, that was foolish!” “He spat at you,” said Harry. (cid:145) 593 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY “Potter, I — that was very — very gallant of you — but don’t you realize — ?” “Yeah,  I  do,”  Harry  assured  her.  Somehow  her  panic  steadied him. “Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on the way.” “Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. This appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered  backward  and  fell  into  a  nearby  chair,  clutching  at  the neck of her old tartan dressing gown. “I don’t think it makes any difference what we call him,” Harry told Luna. “He already knows where I am.” In a distant part of Harry’s brain, that part connected to the an-gry, burning scar, he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat. . . . He had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood. . . . “You must flee,” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Now, Potter, as quickly as you can!” “I can’t,” said Harry. “There’s something I need to do. Professor, do you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?” “The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not — hasn’t it been lost for centuries?” She sat up a little straighter. “Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle —” “I had to,” said Harry. “Professor, there’s something hidden here that I’m supposed to find, and it could be the diadem — if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick —” There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass: Amycus was coming round. Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGona-gall rose to her feet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater, and said, “Imperio.” (cid:145) 594 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SACKING  OF SEVERUS  SNAPE Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto. Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shim-mering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly together. “Potter,”  said  Professor  McGonagall,  turning  to  face  him again  with  superb  indifference  to  the  Carrows’  predicament,  “if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named  does  indeed  know  that  you  are here —” As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry,  setting  his  scar  on  fire,  and  for  a  second  he  looked  down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface — “Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and Harry came back: He was clutching Luna’s shoulder to steady himself. “Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer. Professor, I’m acting on Dumbledore’s orders, I must find what he wanted me to find! But we’ve got to get the students out while I’m searching the castle — it’s me Voldemort wants, but he won’t care about killing a few more or less, not now —” not now he knows I’m attacking Hor-cruxes, Harry finished the sentence in his head. “You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated with a look of dawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height. “We  shall  secure  the  school  against  He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while you search for this — this object.” “Is that possible?” “I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we teachers are rather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold (cid:145) 595 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape —” “Let me —” “— and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark  Lord  at  the  gates,  it  would  indeed  be  advisable  to  take  as many  innocent  people  out  of  the  way  as  possible.  With  the  Floo Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the grounds —” “There’s a way,” said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway leading into the Hog’s Head. “Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students —” “I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in anyone who’s Disapparating out of the Hog’s Head.” “There’s something in that,” she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Carrows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around  them,  and  hoisted  them  into  the  air,  where  they  dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures. “Come. We must alert the other Heads of House. You’d better put that Cloak back on.” She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spi-ral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and Luna hurried back down. Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them; Professor McGonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.  (cid:145) 596 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SACKING  OF SEVERUS  SNAPE They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps joined theirs. Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first: He felt in the pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s Map, but before he could take it out, McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their company. She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, “Who’s there?” “It is I,” said a low voice. From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape. Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had forgotten the  details  of  Snape’s  appearance  in  the  magnitude  of  his  crimes, forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight. “Where are the Carrows?” he asked quietly. “Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,” said Profes-sor McGonagall. Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGona-gall  into  the  air  around  her,  as  if  he  knew  that  Harry  was  there. Harry held his wand up too, ready to attack. “I was under the impression,” said Snape, “that Alecto had ap-prehended an intruder.” impression?” “Really?”  said  Professor  McGonagall.  “And  what  gave  you  that Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into his skin. “Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “You Death Eat-ers have your own private means of communication, I forgot.”  (cid:145) 597 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still prob-ing the air all about her, and he was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing. “I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors, Minerva.” “You have some objection?” “I wonder what could have brought you out of your bed at this late hour?” “I thought I heard a disturbance,” said Professor McGonagall. “Really? But all seems calm.” Snape looked into her eyes. “Have  you  seen  Harry  Potter,  Minerva?  Because  if  you  have,  I must insist —” Professor  McGonagall  moved  faster  than  Harry  could  have  be-lieved: Her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his  Shield  Charm  was  such  that  McGonagall  was  thrown  off  bal-ance. She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape — Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGona-gall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast — “Minerva!”  said  a  squeaky  voice,  and  looking  behind  him,  still shielding  Luna  from  flying  spells,  Harry  saw  Professors  Flitwick and  Sprout  sprinting  up  the  corridor  toward  them  in  their  night-(cid:145) 598 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SACKING  OF SEVERUS  SNAPE clothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear. “No!”  squealed  Flitwick,  raising  his  wand.  “You’ll  do  no  more murder at Hogwarts!” Flitwick’s  spell  hit  the  suit  of  armor  behind  which  Snape  had taken shelter: With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of  the  crushing  arms  and  sent  it  flying  back  toward  his  attackers: Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in full  flight,  McGonagall,  Flitwick,  and  Sprout  all  thundering  after him: He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, “Coward! COWARD!” “What’s happened, what’s happened?” asked Luna. Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corri-dor,  trailing  the  Invisibility  Cloak  behind  them,  into  the  deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window. “He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room. “You mean he’s dead?” Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at his sudden appearance. “No, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike Dumble-dore, he was still carrying a wand . . . and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.” With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, batlike shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall. There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puff-ing: Slughorn had just caught up. “Harry!”  he  panted,  massaging  his  immense  chest  beneath  his (cid:145) 599 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY emerald-green silk pajamas. “My dear boy . . . what a surprise . . . Minerva, do please explain. . . . Severus . . . what . . . ?” “Our headmaster is taking a short break,” said Professor McGona-gall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window. “Professor!” Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead. He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt the ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort leapt from it with murder in his heart — “Professor, we’ve got to barricade the school, he’s coming now!” “Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,” she told the other teachers. Sprout and Flitwick gasped; Slughorn let out a low  groan.  “Potter  has  work  to  do  in  the  castle  on  Dumbledore’s orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he needs to do.” “You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely?” squeaked Flitwick. “But we can hold him up,” said Professor Sprout. “Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding. “I sug-gest  we  establish  basic  protection  around  the  place,  then  gather our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though  if  any  of  those  who  are  over  age  wish  to  stay  and  fight,  I think they ought to be given the chance.” “Agreed,”  said  Professor  Sprout,  already  hurrying  toward  the door. “I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.” And  as  she  jogged  out  of  sight,  they could hear her muttering, “Tentacula. Devil’s Snare. And Snargaluff pods . . . yes, I’d like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.” (cid:145) 600 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SACKING  OF SEVERUS  SNAPE “I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started  muttering  incantations  of  great  complexity.  Harry  heard  a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds. “Professor,”  Harry  said,  approaching  the  little  Charms  master, “Professor, I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?” “—  Protego  Horribilis  —  the  diadem  of  Ravenclaw?”  squeaked Flitwick. “A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!” “I  only  meant  —  do  you  know  where  it  is?  Have  you  ever seen it?” “Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy!” Harry  felt  a  mixture  of  desperate  disappointment  and  panic. What, then, was the Horcrux? “We  shall  meet  you  and  your  Ravenclaws  in  the  Great  Hall, Filius!” said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her. They  had  just  reached  the  door  when  Slughorn  rumbled  into speech. “My  word,”  he  puffed,  pale  and  sweaty,  his  walrus  mustache aquiver.  “What  a  to-do!  I’m  not  at  all  sure  whether  this  is  wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in most grievous peril —” “I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes,  also,”  said  Professor  McGonagall.  “If  you  wish  to  leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt (cid:145) 601 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY to  sabotage  our  resistance  or  take  up  arms  against  us  within  this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.” “Minerva!” he said, aghast. “The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyal-ties,”  interrupted  Professor  McGonagall.  “Go  and  wake  your  stu-dents, Horace.” Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and Luna ran after  Professor  McGonagall,  who  had  taken  up  a  position  in  the middle of the corridor and raised her wand. “Piertotum — oh, for heaven’s sake, Filch, not now —” The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting, “Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!” “They’re supposed to be, you blithering idiot!” shouted McGona-gall. “Now go and do something constructive! Find Peeves!” “P-Peeves?” stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before. “Yes,  Peeves,  you  fool,  Peeves!  Haven’t  you  been  complaining about him for a quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once!” Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath. “And now — Piertotum Locomotor!” cried Professor McGonagall. And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down  from  their  plinths,  and  from  the  echoing  crashes  from  the floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same. “Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “Man the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!” Clattering  and  yelling,  the  horde  of  moving  statues  stampeded (cid:145) 602 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SACKING  OF SEVERUS  SNAPE past Harry: some of them smaller, others larger, than life. There were animals too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains. “Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.” They  parted  at  the  top  of  the  next  staircase,  Harry  and  Luna running  back  toward  the  concealed  entrance  to  the  Room  of  Re-quirement. As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects. “That was Potter!” “Harry Potter!” “It was him, I swear, I just saw him!” But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted wall,  which  opened  to  admit  them,  and  he  and  Luna  sped  back down the steep staircase. “Wh — ?” As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood,  Katie  Bell,  Angelina  Johnson  and  Alicia  Spinnet,  Bill  and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. “Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs. “Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school — Snape’s run for it — What are you doing here? How did you know?” “We  sent  messages  to  the  rest  of  Dumbledore’s  Army,”  Fred (cid:145) 603 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY explained.  “You  couldn’t  expect  everyone  to  miss  the  fun,  Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of snowballed.” “What first, Harry?” called George. “What’s going on?” “They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s meeting in the Great Hall to get organized,” Harry said. “We’re fighting.” There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members  of  the  Order  of  the  Phoenix,  Dumbledore’s  Army,  and Harry’s  old  Quidditch  team,  all  with  their  wands  drawn,  heading up into the main castle. “Come on, Luna,” Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand; she took it and followed him back up the stairs. The crowd was thinning: Only a little knot of people remained below in the Room of Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley  was  struggling  with  Ginny.  Around  them  stood  Lupin, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur. “You’re underage!” Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached. “I won’t permit it! The boys, yes, but you, you’ve got to go home!” “I won’t!” Ginny’s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother’s grip. “I’m in Dumbledore’s Army —” “A teenagers’ gang!” “A teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on, which no one else has dared to do!” said Fred. “She’s  sixteen!”  shouted  Mrs.  Weasley.  “She’s  not  old  enough! What you two were thinking, bringing her with you —” Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves. (cid:145) 604 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SACKING  OF SEVERUS  SNAPE “Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently. “You can’t do this. Every-one underage will have to leave, it’s only right.” “I can’t go home!” Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. “My whole family’s here, I can’t stand waiting there alone and not knowing and —” Her eyes met Harry’s for the first time. She looked at him be-seechingly, but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly. “Fine,” she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog’s Head. “I’ll say good-bye now, then, and —” There was a scuffling and a great thump: Someone else had clam-bered out of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself  up  on  the  nearest  chair,  looked  around  through  lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and said, “Am I too late? Has it started? I only just found out, so I — I —” Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension, “So — ’ow eez leetle Teddy?” Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed to be solidifying, like ice. “I — oh yes — he’s fine!” Lupin said loudly. “Yes, Tonks is with him — at her mother’s —” Percy  and  the  other  Weasleys  were  still  staring  at  one  another, frozen. “Here, I’ve got a picture!” Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat fists at the camera. “I was a fool!” Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped (cid:145) 605 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY his photograph. “I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a — a —” “Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,” said Fred. Percy swallowed. “Yes, I was!” “Well, you can’t say fairer than that,” said Fred, holding out his hand to Percy. Mrs.  Weasley  burst  into  tears.  She  ran  forward,  pushed  Fred aside, and pulled Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father. “I’m sorry, Dad,” Percy said. Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son. “What made you see sense, Perce?” inquired George. “It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak. “But I had to find a way out and it’s not so easy at the Ministry, they’re imprison-ing traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am.” “Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,”  said  George  in  a  good  imitation  of  Percy’s  most  pompous manner.  “Now  let’s  get  upstairs  and  fight,  or  all  the  good  Death Eaters’ll be taken.” “So, you’re my sister-in-law now?” said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur  as  they  hurried  off  toward  the  staircase  with  Bill,  Fred,  and George. “Ginny!” barked Mrs. Weasley. (cid:145) 606 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  SACKING  OF SEVERUS  SNAPE Ginny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliation, to sneak upstairs too. “Molly, how about this,” said Lupin. “Why doesn’t Ginny stay here, then at least she’ll be on the scene and know what’s going on, but she won’t be in the middle of the fighting?” “I —” “That’s a good idea,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “Ginny, you stay in this room, you hear me?” Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father’s unusually stern gaze, she nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off for the stairs as well. “Where’s Ron?” asked Harry. “Where’s Hermione?” “They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,” Mr. Weasley called over his shoulder. “I didn’t see them pass me,” said Harry. “They said something about a bathroom,” said Ginny, “not long after you left.” “A bathroom?” Harry  strode  across  the  room  to  an  open  door  leading  off  the Room  of  Requirement  and  checked  the  bathroom  beyond.  It  was empty. “You’re sure they said bath — ?” But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished: He was looking through the high wrought-iron gates with winged boars  on  pillars  at  either  side,  looking  through  the  dark  grounds toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped over  his  shoulders.  He  was  possessed  of  that  cold,  cruel  sense  of purpose that preceded murder. (cid:145) 607 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T H I R T Y - O N E THE BATTLE OF  HOGWARTS  T he  enchanted  ceiling  of  the  Great Hall was dark and scat-tered  with  stars,  and  below  it  the  four  long  House  tables were lined with disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Profes-sor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight. “. . . evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madam Pom-frey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.” Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the  walls,  scanning  the  Gryffindor  table  for  Ron  and  Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, “And what if we want to stay and fight?” (cid:145) 608 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS There was a smattering of applause. “If you are of age, you may stay,” said Professor McGonagall. “What  about  our  things?”  called  a  girl  at  the  Ravenclaw  table. “Our trunks, our owls?” “We have no time to collect possessions,” said Professor McGona-gall. “The important thing is to get you out of here safely.” “Where’s  Professor  Snape?”  shouted  a  girl  from  the  Slytherin table. “He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” replied Pro-fessor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws. Harry  moved  up  the  Hall  alongside  the  Gryffindor  table,  still looking  for  Ron  and  Hermione.  As  he  passed,  faces  turned  in  his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake. “We have already placed protection around the castle,” Professor McGonagall was saying, “but it is unlikely to hold for very long un-less we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects —” But  her  final  words  were  drowned  as  a  different  voice  echoed throughout  the  Hall.  It  was  high,  cold,  and  clear:  There  was  no telling from where it came; it seemed to issue from the walls them-selves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain dormant there for centuries. “I  know  that  you  are  preparing  to  fight.”  There  were  screams amongst the students, some of whom clutched each other, look-ing around in terror for the source of the sound. “Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.” (cid:145) 609 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against  the  eardrums,  that  seems  too  huge  to  be  contained  by walls. “Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort’s voice, “and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school un-touched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. “You have until midnight.” The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen in  the  glare  of  thousands  of  invisible  beams.  Then  a  figure  rose from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed, “But he’s there! Potter’s there! Someone grab him!” Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same  moment,  the  Ravenclaws,  all  of  them  with  their  backs  to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awe-struck  and  overwhelmed,  saw  wands  emerging  everywhere,  pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves. “Thank  you,  Miss  Parkinson,”  said  Professor  McGonagall  in  a clipped voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.” Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall. “Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall. Slowly  the  four  tables  emptied.  The  Slytherin  table  was  com-pletely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, (cid:145) 610 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Profes-sor McGonagall’s descent from the teachers’ platform to chivvy the underage on their way. “Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!” Harry  hurried  over  to  the  Weasleys,  all  sitting  together  at  the Gryffindor table. “Where are Ron and Hermione?” “Haven’t you found — ?” began Mr. Weasley, looking worried. But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind. “We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast! A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hog-warts  and  the  Order  of  the  Phoenix.  Professors  Flitwick,  Sprout, and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers — Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor — where they’ll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile Remus” — he indicated Lupin — “Arthur” — he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the Gryffindor table — “and I will take groups into the grounds. We’ll need somebody to organize defense of the entrances of the passageways into the school —” “Sounds  like  a  job  for  us,”  called  Fred,  indicating  himself  and George, and Kingsley nodded his approval. “All right, leaders up here and we’ll divide up the troops!” “Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as stu-dents flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instruc-tions, “Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?” “What? Oh,” said Harry, “oh yeah!” He  had  almost  forgotten  about  the  Horcrux,  almost  forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it: The (cid:145) 611 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind. “Then go, Potter, go!” “Right — yeah —” He  sensed  eyes  following  him  as  he  ran  out  of  the  Great  Hall again, into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them, but  at  the  top  he  hurried  off  along  a  deserted  corridor.  Fear  and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder’s Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron’s or Hermione’s names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of  Requirement  might,  he  thought,  be  concealing  them.  He  put the map away, pressed his hands over his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. . . . Voldemort thought I’d go to Ravenclaw Tower. There it was: a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had sta-tioned Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could only be one explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House. But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem . . . and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem  that  had  eluded  generations  of  Ravenclaws?  Who  could (cid:145) 612 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory? In living memory . . . Beneath  his  fingers,  Harry’s  eyes  flew  open  again.  He  leapt  up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of  his  one  last  hope.  The  sound  of  hundreds  of  people  marching toward  the  Room  of  Requirement  grew  louder  and  louder  as  he returned  to  the  marble  stairs.  Prefects  were  shouting  instructions, trying  to  keep  track  of  the  students  in  their  own  Houses;  there was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowl-ing over first-years to get to the front of the queue; here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings. . . . Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the en-trance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor. “Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!” He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reach-ing the bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him. “Harry! My dear boy!” Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as though they had been thrust into icy water. “Nick,  you’ve  got  to  help  me.  Who’s  the  ghost  of  Ravenclaw Tower?” Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended. “The  Gray  Lady,  of  course;  but  if  it  is  ghostly  services  you require — ?” “It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?” “Let’s see. . . .” (cid:145) 613 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering over the heads of the swarming students. “That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.” Harry  looked  in  the  direction  of  Nick’s  transparent,  pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall. Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the pas-sage, still gliding smoothly away from him. “Hey — wait — come back!” She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry  supposed  that  she  was  beautiful,  with  her  waist-length  hair and  floor-length  cloak,  but  she  also  looked  haughty  and  proud. Close to, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken. “You’re the Gray Lady?” She nodded but did not speak. “The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?” “That is correct.” Her tone was not encouraging. “Please: I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem.” A cold smile curved her lips. “I am afraid,” she said, turning to leave, “that I cannot help you.” “WAIT!” He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him: It was a quarter to midnight. (cid:145) 614 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS “This is urgent,” he said fiercely. “If that diadem’s at Hogwarts, I’ve got to find it, fast.” “You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,” she said disdainfully. “Generations of students have badgered me —” “This isn’t about trying to get better marks!” Harry shouted at her. “It’s about Voldemort — defeating Voldemort — or aren’t you interested in that?” She  could  not  blush,  but  her  transparent  cheeks  became  more opaque, and her voice was heated as she replied, “Of course I — how dare you suggest — ?” “Well, help me, then!” Her composure was slipping. “It — it is not a question of —” she stammered. “My mother’s diadem —” “Your mother’s?” She looked angry with herself. “When I lived,” she said stiffly, “I was Helena Ravenclaw.” “You’re her daughter? But then, you must know what happened to it!” “While the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together, “I doubt that it would greatly increase your chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord —” “Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing it!” Harry said fiercely. “There’s no time to explain — but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you’ve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!” She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and  a  sense  of  hopelessness  engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who (cid:145) 615 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice. “I stole the diadem from my mother.” “You — you did what?” “I stole the diadem,” repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. “I sought to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it.” He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence, and did not ask; he simply listened, hard, as she went on: “My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dread-ful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts. “Then my mother fell ill — fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so.” Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head. “He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to  return  with  him,  he  became  violent.  The  Baron  was  always  a hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.” “The Baron? You mean — ?” “The Bloody Baron, yes,” said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. “When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself.  All  these  centuries  later,  he  wears  his  chains  as  an  act  of penitence . . . as he should,” she added bitterly.  (cid:145) 616 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS “And . . . and the diadem?” “It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blun-dering  through  the  forest  toward  me.  Concealed  inside  a  hollow tree. “A hollow tree?” repeated Harry. “What tree? Where was this?” “A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother’s reach.” “Albania,”  repeated  Harry.  Sense  was  emerging  miraculously from  confusion,  and  now  he  understood  why  she  was  telling  him what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. “You’ve already told someone this story, haven’t you? Another student?” She closed her eyes and nodded. “I had . . . no idea. . . . He was . . . flattering. He seemed to . . . to understand . . . to sympathize. . . .” Yes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaw’s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right. “Well, you weren’t the first person Riddle wormed things out of,” Harry muttered. “He could be charming when he wanted. . . .” So Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem  out  of  the  Gray  Lady.  He  had  traveled  to  that  far-flung forest  and  retrieved  the  diadem  from  its  hiding  place,  perhaps  as soon  as  he  left  Hogwarts,  before  he  even  started  work  at  Borgin and Burkes. And  wouldn’t  those  secluded  Albanian  woods  have  seemed  an excellent refuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years? But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not   (cid:145) 617 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE been left in that lowly tree. . . . No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there — “—  the  night  he  asked  for  a  job!”  said  Harry,  finishing  his thought. “I beg your pardon?” “He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumble-dore to let him teach!” said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. “He must’ve hidden the diadem on his way up  to,  or  down  from,  Dumbledore’s  office!  But  it  was  still  worth trying  to  get  the  job  —  then  he  might’ve  got  the  chance  to  nick Gryffindor’s sword as well — thank you, thanks!” Harry  left  her  floating  there,  looking  utterly  bewildered.  As  he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it was. . . . Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; that sug-gested that it was not in Ravenclaw Tower — but if not there, where? What  hiding  place  had  Tom  Riddle  discovered  inside  Hogwarts Castle, that he believed would remain secret forever? Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the op-posite wall. Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at Harry. “Hagrid!”  Harry  bellowed,  fighting  off  Fang  the  boarhound’s attentions  as  the  enormous  bearded  figure  clambered  to  his  feet. “What the — ?” “Harry, yer here! Yer here!” (cid:145) 618 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug, then ran back to the shattered window. “Good boy, Grawpy!” he bellowed through the hole in the win-dow. “I’ll see yer in a moment, there’s a good lad!” Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down at his watch: It was midnight. The battle had begun. “Blimey, Harry,” panted Hagrid, “this is it, eh? Time ter fight?” “Hagrid, where have you come from?” “Heard  You-Know-Who  from  up  in  our  cave,”  said  Hagrid grimly.  “Voice  carried,  didn’  it?  ‘Yeh  got  till  midnight  ter  gimme Potter.’  Knew  yeh  mus’  be  here,  knew  what  mus’  be  happenin’. Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an’ Grawpy an’ Fang. Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin’ us, Fang an’ me. Told him ter let me down at the castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exac’ly what I meant, bu’ — where’s Ron an’ Hermione?” “That,” said Harry, “is a really good question. Come on.” They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them. Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds. “Where’re we goin’?” puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry’s heels, making the floorboards quake. “I  dunno  exactly,”  said  Harry,  making  another  random  turn, “but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere. . . .” The  first  casualties  of  the  battle  were  already  strewn  across  the passage  ahead:  The  two  stone  gargoyles  that  usually  guarded  the entrance  to  the  staffroom  had  been  smashed  apart  by  a  jinx  that (cid:145) 619 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE had sailed through another broken  window.  Their  remains  stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly, “Oh, don’t mind me . . . I’ll just lie here and crumble. . . .” Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of  Rowena  Ravenclaw  at  Xenophilius’s  house,  wearing  that  mad headdress — and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem upon her white curls. . . . And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone  effigy  came  back  to  him:  that  of  an  ugly  old  warlock,  onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly stumbled. He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . . Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have  been  arrogant  enough  to  assume  that  he,  and  only  he,  had penetrated  the  deepest  mysteries  of  Hogwarts  Castle.  Of  course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school — here at last was a secret he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered — He  was  roused  by  Professor  Sprout,  who  was  thundering  past followed  by  Neville  and  half  a  dozen  others,  all  of  them  wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants. “Mandrakes!” Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. “Going to lob them over the walls — they won’t like this!” Harry knew now where to go: He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang galloping behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the   (cid:145) 620 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each others’ canvases, screaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook, and Harry  knew,  as  a  gigantic  vase  blew  off  its  plinth  with  explosive force,  that  it  was  in  the  grip  of  enchantments  more  sinister  than those of the teachers and the Order. “It’s all righ’, Fang — it’s all righ’!” yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound  had  taken  flight  as  slivers  of  china  flew  like  shrapnel through  the  air,  and  Hagrid  pounded  off  after  the  terrified  dog, leaving Harry alone. He  forged  on  through  the  trembling  passages,  his  wand  at  the ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clank-ing along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony cantering behind him. “Braggarts  and  rogues,  dogs  and  scoundrels,  drive  them  out, Harry Potter, see them off!” Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of  students,  including  Lee  Jordan  and  Hannah  Abbott,  standing beside  another  empty  plinth,  whose  statue  had  concealed  a  secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole. “Nice night for it!” Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return them to their proper place. . . .  (cid:145) 621 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE “Potter!” Aberforth  Dumbledore  stood  blocking  the  corridor  ahead,  his wand held ready. “I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!” “I know, we’re evacuating,” Harry said, “Voldemort’s —” “— attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah,” said Aberforth, “I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it  never  occurred  to  any  of  you  to  keep  a  few  Slytherins  hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you’ve just sent to safety. Wouldn’t it have been a bit smarter to keep ’em here?” “It  wouldn’t  stop  Voldemort,”  said  Harry,  “and  your  brother would never have done it.” Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction. Your brother would never have done it. . . . Well, it was the truth, Harry thought as he ran on again; Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom. . . . And  then  he  skidded  around  a  final  corner  and  with  a  yell  of mingled  relief  and  fury  he  saw  them:  Ron  and  Hermione,  both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arm. “Where the hell have you been?” Harry shouted. “Chamber of Secrets,” said Ron. “Chamber  —  what?”  said  Harry,  coming  to  an  unsteady  halt before them. “It was Ron, all Ron’s idea!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Wasn’t it absolutely brilliant? There we were, after you left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn’t got rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk!” (cid:145) 622 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS “What the — ?” “Something to get rid of Horcruxes,” said Ron simply. Harry’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermi-one’s arms: great curved fangs, torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk. “But how did you get in there?” he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. “You need to speak Parseltongue!” “He did!” whispered Hermione. “Show him, Ron!” Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise. “It’s what you did to open the locket,” he told Harry apologeti-cally.  “I  had  to  have  a  few  goes  to  get  it  right,  but,”  he  shrugged modestly, “we got there in the end.” “He was amazing.” said Hermione. “Amazing!” “So . . .” Harry was struggling to keep up. “So . . .” “So we’re another Horcrux down,” said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff’s cup. “Hermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn’t had the pleasure yet.” “Genius!” yelled Harry. “It  was  nothing,”  said  Ron,  though  he  looked  delighted  with himself. “So what’s new with you?” As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three of  them  looked  up  as  dust  fell  from  the  ceiling  and  they  heard  a distant scream. “I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,” said Harry, talking fast. “He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.” As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the  concealed  entrance  and  down  the  staircase  into  the  Room  of (cid:145) 623 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE Requirement. It was empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks, and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry rec-ognized immediately as Neville’s grandmother. “Ah, Potter,” she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. “You can tell us what’s going on.” “Is everyone okay?” said Ginny and Tonks together. “ ’S far as we know,” said Harry. “Are there still people in the pas-sage to the Hog’s Head?” He  knew  that  the  room  would  not  be  able  to  transform  while there were still users inside it. “I was the last to come through,” said Mrs. Longbottom. “I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?” “He’s fighting,” said Harry. “Naturally,”  said  the  old  lady  proudly.  “Excuse  me,  I  must  go and assist him.” With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps. Harry looked at Tonks. “I  thought  you  were  supposed  to  be  with  Teddy  at  your mother’s?” “I  couldn’t  stand  not  knowing  —”  Tonks  looked  anguished. “She’ll look after him — have you seen Remus?” “He  was  planning  to  lead  a  group  of  fighters  into  the grounds —” Without another word, Tonks sped off. “Ginny,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can come back in.” Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.  (cid:145) 624 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS “And then you can come back in!” he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks. “You’ve got to come back in!” “Hang  on  a  moment!”  said  Ron  sharply.  “We’ve  forgotten someone!” they?” “Who?” asked Hermione. “The  house-elves,  they’ll  all  be  down  in  the  kitchen,  won’t “You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked Harry. “No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean we should tell them to get out. We don’t want any more Dobbies, do we? We can’t order them to die for us —” There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermi-one’s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broom-stick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. “Is  this  the  moment?”  Harry  asked  weakly,  and  when  nothing happened  except  that  Ron  and  Hermione  gripped  each  other  still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. “OI! There’s a war going on here!” Ron  and  Hermione  broke  apart,  their  arms  still  around  each other. “I know, mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been  hit  on  the  back  of  the  head  with  a  Bludger,  “so  it’s  now  or never, isn’t it?” “Never  mind  that,  what  about  the  Horcrux?”  Harry  shouted. “D’you think you could just — just hold it in until we’ve got the diadem?”  (cid:145) 625 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE “Yeah — right — sorry —” said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face. It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs,  that  in  the  minutes  that  they  had  spent  in  the  Room  of Requirement  the  situation  within  the  castle  had  deteriorated  se-verely:  The  walls  and  ceiling  were  shaking  worse  than  ever;  dust filled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Look-ing down, Harry  saw Grawp  the  giant  meandering  past,  swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure. “Let’s hope he steps on some of them!” said Ron as more screams echoed from close by. “As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: Harry turned and saw Ginny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next win-dow, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below. “Good  girl!”  roared  a  figure  running  through  the  dust  toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past. “They look like they might be breach-ing the north battlements, they’ve brought giants of their own!” “Have you seen Remus?” Tonks called after him. “He was dueling Dolohov,” shouted Aberforth, “haven’t seen him since! “Tonks,” said Ginny, “Tonks, I’m sure he’s okay —” But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth. Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “They’ll  be  all  right,”  said  Harry,  though  he  knew  they  were (cid:145) 626 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS empty words. “Ginny, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe — come on!” he said to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant. I need the place where everything is hidden, Harry begged of it in-side his head, and the door materialized on their third run past. The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the thresh-old and closed the door behind them: All was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its towering  walls  built  of  objects  hidden  by  thousands  of  long-gone students. “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence. “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in my time . . . this way,” he added, “I think it’s down here. . . .” He  passed  the  stuffed  troll  and  the  Vanishing  Cabinet  Draco Malfoy  had  mended  last  year  with  such  disastrous  consequences, then  hesitated,  looking  up  and  down  aisles  of  junk;  he  could  not remember where to go next. . . . “Accio Diadem!” cried Hermione in desperation, but nothing flew through the air toward them. It seemed that, like the vault at Grin-gotts, the room would not yield its hidden objects that easily. “Let’s split up,” Harry told the other two. “Look for a stone bust of an old man wearing a wig and a tiara! It’s standing on a cupboard and it’s definitely somewhere near here. . . .” They  sped  off  up  adjacent  aisles;  Harry  could  hear  the  others’ footsteps  echoing  through  the  towering  piles  of  junk,  of  bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats. . . . (cid:145) 627 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE “Somewhere  near  here,”  Harry  muttered  to  himself.  “Some-where . . . somewhere . . .” Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to shiver: There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he had hid-den his old Potions book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient, discolored tiara. He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained ten feet away, when a voice behind him said, “Hold it, Potter.” He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at  Harry.  Through  the  small  space  between  their  jeering  faces  he saw Draco Malfoy. “That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” said Malfoy, pointing his own through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle. “Not anymore,” panted Harry, tightening his grip on the haw-thorn wand. “Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you theirs?” “My mother,” said Draco. Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. He could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem. “So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort?” asked Harry. “We’re gonna be rewarded,” said Crabbe: His voice was surpris-ingly soft for such an enormous person; Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. Crabbe was smiling like a small child promised a large bag of sweets. “We ’ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to ’im.” (cid:145) 628 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS “Good plan,” said Harry in mock admiration. He could not be-lieve that he was this close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging slowly backward toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out . . . “So how did you get in here?” he asked, trying to distract them. “I  virtually  lived  in  the  Room  of  Hidden  Things  all  last  year,” said Malfoy, his voice brittle. “I know how to get in.” “We was hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted Goyle. “We can do Diss-lusion Charms now! And then,” his face split into a gormless grin, “you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum! What’s a die-dum?” “Harry?” Ron’s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry’s right. “Are you talking to someone?” With  a  whiplike  movement,  Crabbe  pointed  his  wand  at  the fifty-foot mountain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, “Descendo!” The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where Ron stood. “Ron!”  Harry  bellowed,  as  somewhere  out  of  sight  Hermione screamed,  and  Harry  heard  innumerable  objects  crashing  to  the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall: He pointed his wand at the rampart, cried, “Finite!” and it steadied. “No!” shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe’s arm as the latter made to  repeat  his  spell.  “If  you  wreck  the  room  you  might  bury  this diadem thing!” “What’s  that  matter?”  said  Crabbe,  tugging  himself  free.  “It’s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?” “Potter  came  in  here  to  get  it,”  said  Malfoy  with  ill-disguised (cid:145) 629 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE impatience  at  the  slow-wittedness  of  his  colleagues,  “so  that  must mean —” “ ‘Must mean’?” Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised fe-rocity. “Who cares what you think? I don’t take your orders no more, Draco. You an’ your dad are finished.” “Harry?”  shouted  Ron  again,  from  the  other  side  of  the  junk wall. “What’s going on?” “Harry?”  mimicked  Crabbe.  “What’s  going  —  no,  Potter! Crucio!” Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe’s curse missed him but hit the stone bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested. “STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room. “The Dark Lord wants him alive —” “So?  I’m  not  killing  him,  am  I?”  yelled  Crabbe,  throwing  off Malfoy’s restraining arm. “But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what’s the diff — ?” A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe’s head. It only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the way. “It’s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!” Harry  saw  Hermione  dive  aside,  and  his  fury  that  Crabbe  had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at  Crabbe,  who  lurched  out  of  the  way,  knocking  Malfoy’s  wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and boxes. “Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!” Malfoy yelled at Crabbe (cid:145) 630 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS and  Goyle,  who  were  both  aiming  at  Harry:  Their  split  second’s hesitation was all Harry needed. “Expelliarmus!” Goyle’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bul-wark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to  retrieve  it;  Malfoy  jumped  out  of  range  of  Hermione’s  second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed. Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, “Avada  Kedavra!”  again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. The wand-less Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione charged  toward  them,  hitting  Goyle  with  a  Stunning  Spell  as  she came. “It’s somewhere here!” Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. “Look for it while I go and help R —” “HARRY!” she screamed. A  roaring,  billowing  noise  behind  him  gave  him  a  moment’s warning. He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them. “Like it hot, scum?” roared Crabbe as he ran. But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch. “Aguamenti!” Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air. “RUN!” Malfoy  grabbed  the  Stunned  Goyle  and  dragged  him  along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron, (cid:145) 631 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge: As they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient, intent upon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were  feeding  was  thrown up in the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron, and Hermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them. “What can we do?” Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. “What can we do?” “Here!” Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students,  the  guilty  outcomes  of  a  thousand  banned  experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere: He  swooped  as  low  as  he  dared  over  the  marauding  monsters  of flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . . (cid:145) 632 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS “Harry, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke. And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame. “It’s — too — dangerous — !” Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood. . . . And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good: Goyle was  too  heavy  and  Malfoy’s  hand,  covered  in  sweat,  slid  instantly out of Harry’s — “IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” roared Ron’s voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose, roll-ing  and  pitching,  into  the  air  once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry. “The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed Malfoy in Har-ry’s ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara — “What  are  you  doing,  what  are  you  doing,  the  door’s  that  way!” screamed Malfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it (cid:145) 633 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist — Harry  swerved  again  as  the  serpent  lunged  at  him;  he  soared upward  and  straight  toward  the  place  where,  he  prayed,  the  door stood open: Ron, Hermione, and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond. Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious. “C-Crabbe,”  choked  Malfoy  as  soon  as  he  could  speak.  “C-Crabbe . . .” “He’s dead,” said Ron harshly. There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a num-ber of huge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of trans-parent figures galloped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust  under  their  arms.  Harry  staggered  to  his  feet  when  the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all around him. He could hear more screams than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him. “Where’s Ginny?” he said sharply. “She was here. She was sup-posed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.” “Blimey, d’you reckon it’ll still work after that fire?” asked Ron, but  he  too  got  to  his  feet,  rubbing  his  chest  and  looking  left  and right. “Shall we split up and look — ?” “No,” said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle (cid:145) 634 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. “Let’s stick together. I say we go — Harry, what’s that on your arm?” “What? Oh yeah —” He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it: Wit beyond mea-sure is man’s greatest treasure. A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the  diadem.  Suddenly  Harry  felt  the  thing  vibrate  violently,  then break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or  the  castle,  but  from  the  thing  that  had  just  fragmented  in  his fingers. “It  must  have  been  Fiendfyre!”  whimpered  Hermione,  her  eyes on the broken pieces. “Sorry?” “Fiendfyre — cursed fire — it’s one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it’s so danger-ous — how did Crabbe know how to — ?” “Must’ve learned from the Carrows,” said Harry grimly. “Shame  he  wasn’t  concentrating  when  they  mentioned  how  to stop it, really,” said Ron, whose hair, like Hermione’s, was singed, and whose face was blackened. “If he hadn’t tried to kill us all, I’d be quite sorry he was dead.” “But don’t you realize?” whispered Hermione. “This means, if we can just get the snake —” But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of  dueling  filled  the  corridor.  Harry  looked  around  and  his  heart (cid:145) 635 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE seemed  to  fail:  Death  Eaters  had  penetrated  Hogwarts.  Fred  and Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling masked and hooded men. Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  ran  forward  to  help:  Jets  of  light flew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair — “Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his  robes,  apparently  in  awful  discomfort.  “Did  I  mention  I’m resigning?” “You’re joking, Perce!” shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling  collapsed  under  the  weight  of  three  separate  Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupt-ing  all  over  him;  he  seemed  to  be  turning  into  some  form  of  sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee. “You actually are joking, Perce. . . . I don’t think I’ve heard you joke since you were —” The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them — And  then  the  world  resolved  itself  into  pain  and  semidarkness: He  was  half  buried  in  the  wreckage  of  a  corridor  that  had  been (cid:145) 636 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  BATTLE  OF HOGWARTS subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of the castle  had  been  blown  away,  and  hot  stickiness  on  his  cheek  told him that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life. . . . And  Hermione  was  struggling  to her feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione’s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood. “No — no — no!” someone was shouting. “No! Fred! No!” And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them,  and  Fred’s  eyes  stared  without  seeing,  the  ghost  of  his  last laugh still etched upon his face. (cid:145) 637 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T H I R T Y - T W O THE ELDER WAND     T he  world  had  ended,  so  why  had  the  battle  not  ceased,  the castle fallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? Harry’s mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying — And  then  a  body  fell  past  the  hole  blown  into  the  side  of  the school,  and  curses  flew  in  at  them  from  the  darkness,  hitting  the wall behind their heads. “Get  down!”  Harry  shouted,  as  more  curses  flew  through  the night: He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred’s body, shielding it from fur-ther harm, and when Harry shouted, “Percy, come on, we’ve got to move!” he shook his head. “Percy!” Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron’s face as he seized his elder brother’s shoulders and pulled, but Percy   (cid:145) 638 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  ELDER  WAND would not budge. “Percy, you can’t do anything for him! We’re go-ing to —” Hermione  screamed,  and  Harry,  turning,  did  not  need  to  ask why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through  the  huge  hole  in  the  wall:  One  of  Aragog’s  descendants had joined the fight. Ron  and  Harry  shouted  together;  their  spells  collided  and  the monster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness. “It brought friends!” Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, knock-ing the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry’s head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair. “Let’s move, NOW!” Pushing  Hermione  ahead  of  him  with  Ron,  Harry  stooped  to seize  Fred’s  body  under  the  armpits.  Percy,  realizing  what  Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way. “Here,” said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a sec-ond longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which was now full   (cid:145) 639 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, he saw  many  people  running  backward  and  forward,  whether  friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar: “ROOKWOOD!” and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. “Harry, in here!” Hermione screamed. She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wres-tling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy. “Listen to me — LISTEN, RON !” “I wanna help — I wanna kill Death Eaters —” His  face  was  contorted,  smeared  with  dust  and  smoke,  and  he was shaking with rage and grief. “Ron, we’re the only ones who can end it! Please — Ron — we need the snake, we’ve got to kill the snake!” said Hermione. But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not  bring  the  satisfaction  of  revenge;  he  too  wanted  to  fight,  to punish  them,  the  people  who  had  killed  Fred,  and  he  wanted  to find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not — but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind — “We will fight!” Hermione said. “We’ll have to, to reach the snake! But let’s not lose sight now of what we’re supposed to be d-doing! We’re the only ones who can end it!” She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry.  (cid:145) 640 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  ELDER  WAND “You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he’ll have the snake with him, won’t he? Do it, Harry — look inside him!” Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort’s thoughts? He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and the bangs and all the discordant  sounds  of  the  battle  were  drowned  until  they  became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them. . . . He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room it was dark except for a solitary oil lamp. He  was  rolling  his  wand  between  his  fingers,  watching  it,  his thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever found, the room, like the Chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to discover. . . . He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem . . . although Dumbledore’s puppet had come much farther than he had ever expected . . . too far. . . . “My Lord,” said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: There was  Lucius  Malfoy  sitting  in  the  darkest  corner,  ragged  and  still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy’s last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. “My Lord . . . please . . . my son . . .” “If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?” “No — never,” whispered Malfoy.  (cid:145) 641 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO “You must hope not.” “Aren’t — aren’t you afraid, my Lord, that Potter might die at an-other hand but yours?” asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. “Wouldn’t it be . . . forgive me . . . more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, and seek him y-yourself?” “Do not pretend, Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son. And I do not need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come to find me.” Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It troubled him . . . and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rearranged. . . . “Go and fetch Snape.” “Snape, m-my Lord?” “Snape. Now. I need him. There is a — service — I require from him. Go.” Frightened,  stumbling  a  little  through  the  gloom,  Lucius  left the room. Voldemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers, staring at it. “It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twist-ing gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for  her,  a  starry,  transparent  sphere  somewhere  between  glittering cage and tank. With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; at the same moment  his  ears  were  assaulted  with  the  screeches  and  cries,  the smashes and bangs of battle. “He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.” (cid:145) 642 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  ELDER  WAND “Voldemort’s  sitting  in  the  Shrieking  Shack?”  said  Hermione, outraged. “He’s not — he’s not even fighting?” “He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He thinks I’m going to go to him.” “But why?” “He knows I’m after Horcruxes — he’s keeping Nagini close be-side him — obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing —” “Right,” said Ron, squaring his shoulders. “So you can’t go, that’s what  he  wants,  what  he’s  expecting.  You  stay  here  and  look  after Hermione, and I’ll go and get it —” Harry cut across Ron. “You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as soon as I —” Cloak and —” “No,” said Hermione, “it makes much more sense if I take the “Don’t even think about it,” Ron snarled at her. Before Hermione could get farther than “Ron, I’m just as capa-ble —” the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open. “POTTER!” Two  masked  Death  Eaters  stood  there,  but  even  before  their wands were fully raised, Hermione shouted, “Glisseo!” The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she, Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that  the  Death  Eaters’  Stunning  Spells  flew  far  over  their  heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall. “Duro!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and (cid:145) 643 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO there  were  two  loud,  sickening  crunches  as  the  tapestry  turned  to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it. “Get  back!”  shouted  Ron,  and  he,  Harry,  and  Hermione  flat-tened themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thun-dered  past,  shepherded  by  a  sprinting  Professor  McGonagall.  She appeared not to notice them: Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her scream, “CHARGE!” “Harry, you get the Cloak on,” said Hermione. “Never mind us —” But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were, he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells. They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a cor-ridor full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death  Eaters,  both  masked  and  unmasked,  dueled  students  and teachers.  Dean  had  won  himself  a  wand,  for  he  was  face-to-face with  Dolohov,  Parvati  with  Travers.  Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione raised  their  wands  at  once,  ready  to  strike,  but  the  duelers  were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likeli-hood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great “Wheeeeeeeeeeee!” and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. “Argh!” A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron’s head; the slimy (cid:145) 644 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  ELDER  WAND green  roots  were  suspended  improbably  in  midair  as  Ron  tried  to shake them loose. “Someone’s  invisible  there!”  shouted  a  masked  Death  Eater, pointing. Dean  made  the  most  of  the  Death  Eater’s  momentary  distrac-tion, knocking him out with a Stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to retaliate and Parvati shot a Body-Bind Curse at him. “LET’S  GO!”  Harry  yelled,  and  he,  Ron,  and  Hermione  gath-ered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snar-galuff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall. “I’m Draco Malfoy, I’m Draco, I’m on your side!” Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: Mal-foy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused. “And  that’s  the  second  time  we’ve  saved  your  life  tonight,  you two-faced bastard!” Ron yelled. There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall, Death Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in  combat  with  Flitwick,  a  masked  Death  Eater  dueling  Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction, some carrying or dragging  injured  friends.  Harry  directed  a  Stunning  Spell  toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentac-ula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in. (cid:145) 645 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase: Glass shattered to their left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony over-head as they reached the ground, and a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen. “NO!” shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly stir-ring  body  of  Lavender  Brown.  He  hit  the  marble  banisters  and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move. “I have more!” shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the ban-isters. “More for any who want them! Here —” And  with  a  movement  like  a  tennis  serve,  she  heaved  another enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a  window.  At  the  same  moment,  the  heavy  wooden  front  doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the entrance hall. Screams of terror rent the air: The fighters scattered, Death Eat-ers and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever. “How  do  we  get  out?”  yelled  Ron  over  all  the  screaming,  but before  either  Harry  or  Hermione  could  answer  they  were  bowled aside:  Hagrid  had  come  thundering  down  the  stairs,  brandishing his flowery pink umbrella. (cid:145) 646 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  ELDER  WAND “Don’t hurt ’em, don’t hurt ’em!” he yelled. “HAGRID, NO!” Harry  forgot  everything  else:  He  sprinted  out  from  under  the Cloak,  running  bent  double  to  avoid  the  curses  illuminating  the whole hall. “HAGRID, COME BACK!” But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst. “HAGRID!” Harry  heard  someone  calling  his  own  name,  whether  friend  or foe he did not care: He was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. “HAGRID!” He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his  way  was  impeded  by  a  monumental  foot,  which  swung  down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shud-der. He looked up: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its  head  hidden  in  shadow,  nothing  but  its  treelike,  hairy  shins illuminated  by  light  from  the  castle  doors.  With  one  brutal,  fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway. “Oh my — !” shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry  and  gazed  upward  at  the  giant  now  trying  to  seize  people through the window above. (cid:145) 647 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO “DON’T!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised her wand. “Stun him and he’ll crush half the castle —” “HAGGER?” Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did  Harry  realize  that  Grawp  was,  indeed,  an  undersized  giant. The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors looked  around and let  out a roar. The  stone  steps  trembled  as  he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp’s lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half-brick-sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions. “RUN!” Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione’s hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again. The air around them had frozen: Harry’s breath caught and so-lidified  in  his  chest.  Shapes  moved  out  in  the  darkness,  swirling figures  of  concentrated  blackness,  moving  in  a  great  wave  toward the castle, their faces hooded and their breath rattling. . . . Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors  could  bring  was  falling  thickly  through  the  night,  and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead. . . . “Come on, Harry!” said Hermione’s voice from a very long way away. “Patronuses, Harry, come on!” He raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading through him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about; he felt as though his soul had already half left his body. . . . “HARRY, COME ON!” screamed Hermione. (cid:145) 648 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  ELDER  WAND A  hundred  dementors  were  advancing,  gliding  toward  them, sucking their way closer to Harry’s despair, which was like a prom-ise of a feast. . . . He saw Ron’s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and ex-pire; he saw Hermione’s otter twist in midair and fade; and his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling. . . . And then a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past Harry, Ron, and  Hermione’s  heads:  The  dementors  fell  back  before  the  crea-tures’ approach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast their Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus. “That’s right,” said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the  Room  of  Requirement  and  this  was  simply  spell  practice  for the  D.A.  “That’s  right,  Harry  .  .  .  come  on,  think  of  something happy. . . .” “Something happy?” he said, his voice cracked. “We’re all still here,” she whispered, “we’re still fighting. Come on, now. . . .” There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost him, the stag burst from the end of Harry’s wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scat-tered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears. “Can’t  thank  you  enough,”  said  Ron  shakily,  turning  to  Luna, Ernie, and Seamus, “you just saved —” With  a  roar  and  an  earth-quaking  tremor,  another  giant  came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, bran-dishing a club taller than any of them. (cid:145) 649 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO “RUN!” Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling: They all scattered, and not a second too soon, for next moment the creature’s vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing. Harry looked round: Ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished back into the battle. “Let’s get out of range!” yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness. “The Whomping Willow,” said Harry, “go!” Somehow  he  walled  it  all  up  in  his  mind,  crammed  it  into  a small space into which he could not look now: Thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it — He sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death itself, ig-noring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches. Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the Willow’s swiping  branches,  peering  through  the  darkness  toward  its  thick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath she could not speak.  (cid:145) 650 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  ELDER  WAND “How — how’re we going to get in?” panted Ron. “I can — see the place — if we just had — Crookshanks again —” “Crookshanks?” wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. “Are you a wizard, or what?” “Oh — right — yeah —” Ron  looked  around,  then  directed  his  wand  at  a  twig  on  the ground  and  said,  “Wingardium  Leviosa!”  The  twig  flew  up  from the  ground,  spun  through  the  air  as  if  caught  by  a  gust  of  wind, then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow’s ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still. “Perfect!” panted Hermione. “Wait.” For  one  teetering  second,  while  the  crashes  and  booms  of  the battle filled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to come. . . . Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap? But then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: The only way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was, and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . . “Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him forward. Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots. It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: They had had to double up to move through it nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came. They   (cid:145) 651 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO moved  in  silence,  Harry’s  gaze  fixed  upon  the  swinging  beam  of the wand held in his fist. At last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle. “The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!” He  groped  behind  him  and  she  forced  the  bundle  of  slippery cloth into his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmured,  “Nox,”  extinguishing  his  wandlight,  and  continued  on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light. And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall. The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry’s heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched, hidden. “. . . my Lord, their resistance is crumbling —” “— and it is doing so without your help,” said Voldemort in his high, clear voice. “Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there . . . almost.” “Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my Lord. Please.” (cid:145) 652 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  ELDER  WAND Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away his position. . . . Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness. “I have a problem, Severus,” said Voldemort softly. “My Lord?” said Snape. Voldemort  raised  the  Elder  Wand,  holding  it  as  delicately  and precisely as a conductor’s baton. “Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?” In  the  silence  Harry  imagined  he  could  hear  the  snake  hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled — or was it Voldemort’s sibilant sigh lingering on the air? “My  —  my  Lord?”  said  Snape  blankly.  “I  do  not  understand. You — you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.” “No,” said Voldemort. “I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand . . . no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.” Voldemort’s tone was musing, calm, but Harry’s scar had begun to throb and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. “No difference,” said Voldemort again. Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face: He wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure his master. (cid:145) 653 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry. “I have thought long and hard, Severus. . . . Do you know why I have called you back from the battle?” And for a moment Harry saw Snape’s profile: His eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage. “No,  my  Lord,  but  I  beg  you  will  let  me  return.  Let  me  find Potter.” “You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I know his weakness,  you  see,  his  one  great  flaw.  He  will  hate  watching  the others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come.” “But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by one other than yourself —” “My instructions to my Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends — the more, the better — but do not kill him. “But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.” “My  Lord  knows  I  seek  only  to  serve  him.  But  —  let  me  go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can —” “I have told you, no!” said Voldemort, and Harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort’s impatience in his burning scar. “My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!” (cid:145) 654 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  ELDER  WAND “My Lord, there can be no question, surely — ?” “— but there is a question, Severus. There is.” Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape. “Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?” “I — I cannot answer that, my Lord.” “Can’t you?” The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry’s head: He forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, look-ing into Snape’s pale face. “My  wand  of  yew  did  everything  of  which  I  asked  it,  Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another’s wand. I did so, but Lucius’s wand shattered upon meeting Potter’s.” “I — I have no explanation, my Lord.” Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. “I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.” And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape’s face was like a death mask. It was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes. “My Lord — let me go to the boy —” “All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat  here,”  said  Voldemort,  his  voice  barely  louder  than  a  whisper, “wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it (cid:145) 655 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner . . . and I think I have the answer.” Snape did not speak. “Perhaps  you  already  know  it?  You  are  a  clever  man,  after  all, Severus.  You  have  been  a  good  and  faithful  servant,  and  I  regret what must happen.” “My Lord —” “The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine.” “My Lord!” Snape protested, raising his wand. “It cannot be any other way,” said Voldemort. “I must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.” And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did noth-ing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: But then Voldemort’s intention became clear. The snake’s cage  was  rolling  through  the  air,  and  before  Snape  could  do  any-thing more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. “Kill.” There  was  a  terrible  scream.  Harry  saw  Snape’s  face  losing  the little color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs pierced his neck, as  he  failed  to  push  the  enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. “I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly. He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would   (cid:145) 656 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  ELDER  WAND now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from  the  room  without  a  backward  glance,  and  the  great  serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes: He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. “Harry!”  breathed  Hermione  behind  him,  but  he  had  already pointed  his  wand  at  the  crate  blocking  his  view.  It  lifted  an  inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room. He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the  dying  man:  He  did  not  know  what  he  felt  as  he  saw  Snape’s white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his  neck.  Harry  took  off  the  Invisibility  Cloak  and  looked  down upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he tried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close. A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape’s throat. “Take . . . it. . . . Take . . . it. . . .” Something  more  than  blood  was  leaking  from  Snape.  Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do — A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his   (cid:145) 657 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO wand.  When  the  flask  was  full  to  the  brim,  and  Snape  looked  as though  there  was  no  blood  left  in  him,  his  grip  on  Harry’s  robes slackened. “Look . . . at . . . me. . . .” he whispered. The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the  depths  of  the  dark  pair  seemed  to  vanish,  leaving  them  fixed, blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no more. (cid:145) 658 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T H I R T Y - T H R E E THE PRINCE’S TALE    H arry  remained  kneeling  at  Snape’s  side,  simply  staring down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped to his feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room. Voldemort’s  voice  reverberated  from  the  walls  and  floor,  and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the sur-rounding  area,  that  the  residents  of  Hogsmeade  and  all  those  still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away. “You have fought,” said the high, cold voice, “valiantly. Lord Vol-demort knows how to value bravery. “Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. “Lord  Voldemort  is  merciful.  I  command  my  forces  to  retreat immediately. (cid:145) 659 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE “You  have  one  hour.  Dispose  of your  dead  with  dignity.  Treat your injured. “I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.” Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry. “Don’t listen to him,” said Ron. “It’ll be all right,” said Hermione wildly. “Let’s — let’s get back to the castle, if he’s gone to the forest we’ll need to think of a new plan —” She glanced at Snape’s body, then hurried back to the tunnel en-trance. Ron followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done. . . . They  crawled  back  through  the  tunnel,  none  of  them  talking, and  Harry  wondered  whether  Ron  and  Hermione  could  still  hear Voldemort ringing in their heads, as he could. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself.  I  shall  wait  for  one  hour  in  the  Forbidden  Forest.  .  .  .  One hour. . . . Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. It could only be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone clog, the (cid:145) 660 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker. The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters had been blown away. “Where is everyone?” whispered Hermione. Ron  led  the  way  to  the  Great  Hall.  Harry  stopped  in  the doorway. The  House  tables  were  gone  and  the  room  was  crowded.  The survivors  stood  in  groups,  their  arms  around  each  other’s  necks. The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see  Fred’s  body,  because  his  family  surrounded  him.  George  was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred’s chest, her body  shaking,  Mr.  Weasley  stroking  her  hair  while  tears  cascaded down his cheeks. Without  a  word  to  Harry,  Ron  and  Hermione  walked  away. Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron’s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling. The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as  Harry  reeled  backward  from  the  doorway.  He  could  not  draw (cid:145) 661 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died. . . . He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks . . . He yearned not to feel. . . . He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him. . . . The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined  the  mass  mourning  in  the  Great  Hall.  Harry  ran  without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape’s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office. “Password?” “Dumbledore!”  said  Harry  without  thinking,  because  it  was  he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase behind. But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle, so that they could have a clear view of what was going on. Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape’s memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else’s head would be a blessed relief. . . . Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, (cid:145) 662 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE with  a  feeling  of  reckless  abandonment,  as  though  this  would  as-suage his torturing grief, Harry dived. He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was  overlong  and  his  clothes  were  so  mismatched  that  it  looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt. Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. “Lily, don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two. But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and  flown  into  the  air,  quite  literally  flown,  launched  herself  sky-ward with a great shout of  laughter,  and  instead  of  crumpling  on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly. “Mummy told you not to!” Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on  the  ground,  making  a  crunching,  grinding  sound,  then  leapt up, hands on hips. “Mummy said you weren’t allowed, Lily!” “But I’m fine,” said Lily, still giggling. “Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.” Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had (cid:145) 663 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its pet-als, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster. “Stop it!” shrieked Petunia. “It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground. “It’s not right,” said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower’s flight to the ground and lingered upon it. “How do you do it?” she added, and there was definite longing in her voice. “It’s  obvious,  isn’t  it?”  Snape  could  no  longer  contain  himself, but had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A  dull  flush  of  color  mounted  the  sallow  cheeks  as  he  looked  at Lily. “What’s obvious?” asked Lily. Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the dis-tant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, “I know what you are.” “What do you mean?” “You’re . . . you’re a witch,” whispered Snape. She looked affronted. “That’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!” She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. “No!” said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry won-dered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was  because  he  did  not  want  to  reveal  the  smock  beneath  it.  He (cid:145) 664 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE flapped  after  the  girls,  looking  ludicrously  batlike,  like  his  older self. The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag. “You are,” said Snape to Lily. “You are a witch. I’ve been watch-ing you for a while. But there’s nothing wrong with that. My mum’s one, and I’m a wizard.” Petunia’s laugh was like cold water. “Wizard!” she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered  from  the  shock  of  his  unexpected  appearance.  “I  know who you are. You’re that Snape boy! They live down Spinner’s End by the river,” she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. “Why have you been spying on us?” “Haven’t been spying,” said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. “Wouldn’t spy on you, anyway,” he added spitefully, “you’re a Muggle.” Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone. “Lily, come on, we’re leaving!” she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snape’s bitter disappointment, and  understood  that  Snape  had  been  planning  this  moment  for  a while, and that it had all gone wrong. . . . The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other, (cid:145) 665 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light. “. . . and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.” “But I have done magic outside school!” “We’re all right. We haven’t got wands yet. They let you off when you’re a kid and you can’t help it. But once you’re eleven,” he nod-ded importantly, “and they start training you, then you’ve got to go careful.” There was a little silence. Lily had  picked  up  a  fallen  twig  and twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, “It is real, isn’t it? It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn’t it?” “It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her. But we’ll get the letter, you and me.” “Really?” whispered Lily. “Definitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his  odd  clothes,  he  struck  an  oddly  impressive  figure  sprawled  in front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny. “And will it really come by owl?” Lily whispered. “Normally,”  said  Snape.  “But  you’re  Muggle-born,  so  someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.” “Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?” Snape  hesitated.  His  black  eyes,  eager  in  the  greenish  gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair. “No,” he said. “It doesn’t make any difference.”  (cid:145) 666 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE “Good,”  said  Lily,  relaxing:  It  was  clear  that  she  had  been worrying. “You’ve got loads of magic,” said Snape. “I saw that. All the time I was watching you . . .” His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground. “How are things at your house?” Lily asked. A little crease appeared between his eyes. “Fine,” he said. “They’re not arguing anymore?” “Oh yes, they’re arguing,” said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. “But it won’t be that long and I’ll be gone.” “Doesn’t your dad like magic?” “He doesn’t like anything, much,” said Snape. “Severus?” A little smile twisted Snape’s mouth when she said his name. “Yeah?” “Tell me about the dementors again.” “What d’you want to know about them for?” “If I use magic outside school —” “They wouldn’t give you to the dementors for that! Demen-tors are for people who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You’re not going to end up in Azkaban, you’re too —” He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small   (cid:145) 667 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing. “Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet. “Who’s spying now?” he shouted. “What d’you want?” Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say. “What  is  that  you’re  wearing,  anyway?”  she  said,  pointing  at Snape’s chest. “Your mum’s blouse?” There was a crack: A branch over Petunia’s head had fallen. Lily screamed: The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she stag-gered backward and burst into tears. “Tuney!” But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. “Did you make that happen?” “No.” He looked both defiant and scared. “You did!” She was backing away from him. “You did! You hurt her!” “No — no I didn’t!” But the lie did not convince Lily: After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused. . . . And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around: He was on plat-form nine and three-quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched,  next  to  a  thin,  sallow-faced,  sour-looking  woman  who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister; Harry moved closer to listen. (cid:145) 668 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE “. . . I’m sorry, Tuney, I’m sorry! Listen —” She caught her sister’s hand and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. “Maybe once I’m there — no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I’m there, I’ll  be  able  to  go  to  Professor  Dumbledore  and  persuade  him  to change his mind!” “I don’t — want — to — go!” said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister’s grasp. “You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a — a —” Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their  owners’  arms,  over  the  owls  fluttering  and  hooting  at  each other in cages, over the students, some already in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart. “— you think I want to be a — a freak?” Lily’s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away. “I’m not a freak,” said Lily. “That’s a horrible thing to say.” “That’s where you’re going,” said Petunia with relish. “A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy . . . weirdos, that’s what you two are. It’s good you’re being separated from normal people. It’s for our safety.” Lily  glanced  toward  her  parents,  who  were  looking  around  the platform  with  an  air  of  wholehearted  enjoyment,  drinking  in  the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice was low and fierce. “You didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you.” Petunia turned scarlet. “Beg? I didn’t beg!” (cid:145) 669 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE “I saw his reply. It was very kind.” “You shouldn’t have read —” whispered Petunia, “that was my private — how could you — ?” Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. Petunia gasped. “That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!” “No — not sneaking —” Now Lily was on the defensive. “Severus saw the envelope, and he couldn’t believe a Muggle could have con-tacted Hogwarts, that’s all! He says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of —” “Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!” said Petunia, now as pale as she had been flushed. “Freak!” she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her parents stood. . . . The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had  already  changed  into  his  school  robes,  had  perhaps  taken  the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped,  outside  a  compartment  in  which  a  group  of  rowdy  boys were talking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane. Snape  slid  open  the  compartment  door  and  sat  down  opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying. “I don’t want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted voice. “Why not?” “Tuney  h-hates  me.  Because  we  saw  that  letter  from  Dumble-dore.” “So what?” (cid:145) 670 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE She threw him a look of deep dislike. “So she’s my sister!” “She’s only a —” He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him. “But we’re going!” he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. “This is it! We’re off to Hogwarts!” She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. “You’d better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little. “Slytherin?” One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked. “Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile. “My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said. “Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!” Sirius grinned. “Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you’ve got the choice?” James lifted an invisible sword. “ ‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.” Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. “Got a problem with that?” (cid:145) 671 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE “No,” said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. “If you’d rather be brawny than brainy —” “Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” interjected Sirius. James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike. “Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.” “Oooooo . . .” James  and  Sirius  imitated  her  lofty  voice;  James  tried  to  trip Snape as he passed. “See  ya,  Snivellus!”  a  voice  called,  as  the  compartment  door slammed. . . . And the scene dissolved once more. . . . Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House  tables,  lined  with  rapt  faces.  Then  Professor  McGonagall said, “Evans, Lily!” He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down  upon  the  rickety  stool.  Professor  McGonagall  dropped  the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, “Gryffindor!” Harry  heard  Snape  let  out  a  tiny  groan.  Lily  took  off  the  hat, handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on him. The  roll  call  continued.  Harry  watched  Lupin,  Pettigrew,  and his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when (cid:145) 672 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape. Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. “Slytherin!” cried the Sorting Hat. And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from  Lily,  to  where  the  Slytherins  were  cheering  him,  to  where Lucius  Malfoy,  a  prefect  badge  gleaming  upon  his  chest,  patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him. . . . And the scene changed. . . . Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were: A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting. “. . . thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying. “Best friends?” “We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging round with! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he’s creepy! D’you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?” Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face. “That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that’s all —” “It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny —” “What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded Snape. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment. “What’s Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily. “They  sneak  out  at  night.  There’s  something  weird  about  that Lupin. Where does he keep going?” (cid:145) 673 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE “He’s ill,” said Lily. “They say he’s ill —” “Every month at the full moon?” said Snape. “I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they’re doing at night?” “I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.” The intensity of his gaze made her blush. “They don’t use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped her voice. “And you’re being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Wil-low, and James Potter saved you from whatever’s down there —” Snape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered, “Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends’ too! You’re not going to — I won’t let you —” “Let me? Let me?” Lily’s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once. “I didn’t mean — I just don’t want to see you made a fool of — He fancies you, James Potter fancies you!” The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. “And he’s not . . . everyone thinks . . . big Quidditch hero —” Snape’s bitterness and dislike were render-ing him incoherent, and Lily’s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead. “I  know  James  Potter’s  an  arrogant  toerag,”  she  said,  cutting across Snape. “I don’t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber’s and Avery’s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand how you can be friends with them.” Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mul-ciber  and  Avery.  The  moment  she  had  insulted  James  Potter,  his (cid:145) 674 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape’s step. . . . And the scene dissolved. . . . Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place be-neath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no plea-sure to hear it again. . . . He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snape’s defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “Mudblood.” The scene changed. . . . “I’m sorry.” “I’m not interested.” “I’m sorry!” “Save your breath.” It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. “I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.” “I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just —” “Slipped out?” There was no pity in Lily’s voice. “It’s too late. I’ve made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why  I  even  talk  to  you.  You  and  your  precious  little  Death  Eater friends — you see, you don’t even deny it! You don’t even deny that’s (cid:145) 675 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE what you’re all aiming to be! You can’t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?” He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking. “I can’t pretend anymore. You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen mine.” “No — listen, I didn’t mean —” “—  to  call  me  Mudblood?  But  you  call  everyone  of  my  birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?” He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole. . . . The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to re-form: Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or  for  someone.  .  .  .  His  fear  infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for — Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: Harry  thought  of  lightning,  but  Snape  had  dropped  to  his  knees and his wand had flown out of his hand. “Don’t kill me!” “That was not my intention.” Any  sound  of  Dumbledore  Apparating  had  been  drowned  by the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand.  (cid:145) 676 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE “Well,  Severus?  What  message  does  Lord  Voldemort  have  for me?” “No — no message — I’m here on my own account!” Snape was wringing his hands: He looked a little mad, with his straggling black hair flying around him. “I — I come with a warning — no, a request — please —” Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew  through  the  night  air  around  them,  silence  fell  on  the  spot where he and Snape faced each other. “What request could a Death Eater make of me?” “The — the prophecy . . . the prediction . . . Trelawney . . .” “Ah, yes,” said Dumbledore. “How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?” “Everything — everything I heard!” said Snape. “That is why — it is for that reason — he thinks it means Lily Evans!” “The prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said Dumbledore. “It spoke of a boy born at the end of July —” “You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down — kill them all —” “If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, “surely Lord Voldemort  will  spare  her?  Could  you  not  ask  for  mercy  for  the mother, in exchange for the son?” “I have — I have asked him —” “You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. “You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?” Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.  (cid:145) 677 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE “Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep her — them — safe. Please.” “And what will you give me in return, Severus?” “In — in return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, “Anything.” The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, and something  was  making  a  terrible  sound,  like  a  wounded  animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was stand-ing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop. “I thought . . . you were going . . . to keep her . . . safe. . . .” “She and James put their faith in the wrong person,” said Dum-bledore. “Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?” Snape’s breathing was shallow. “Her boy survives,” said Dumbledore. With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irk-some fly. “Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and color of Lily Evans’s eyes, I am sure?” “DON’T!” bellowed Snape. “Gone . . . dead . . .” “Is this remorse, Severus?” “I wish . . . I wish I were dead. . . .” “And  what  use  would  that  be  to  anyone?”  said  Dumbledore coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.” Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore’s words appeared to take a long time to reach him. (cid:145) 678 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE “What — what do you mean?” “You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily’s son.” “He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone —” “The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.” There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of him-self, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, “Very well. Very well. But never — never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear . . . especially Potter’s son . . . I want your word!” “My  word,  Severus,  that  I  shall  never  reveal  the  best  of  you?” Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape’s ferocious, anguished face. “If you insist . . .” The  office  dissolved  but  re-formed  instantly.  Snape  was  pacing up and down in front of Dumbledore. “—  mediocre,  arrogant  as  his  father,  a  determined  rule-breaker,  delighted  to  find  himself  famous,  attention-seeking  and impertinent —” “You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore, with-out  raising  his  eyes  from  a  copy  of  Transfiguration  Today.  “Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably tal-ented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.” Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, “Keep an eye on Quirrell, won’t you?” A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed. “Well?” murmured Dumbledore. (cid:145) 679 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE “Karkaroff’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Minis-try  after  the  Dark  Lord  fell.”  Snape  looked  sideways  at  Dumble-dore’s crooked-nosed profile. “Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.” “Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. “And are you tempted to join him?” “No,” said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur’s and Roger’s retreating figures. “I am not such a coward.” “No,” agreed Dumbledore. “You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon. . . .” He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken. . . . And  now  Harry  stood  in  the  headmaster’s  office  yet  again.  It was nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair  behind  the  desk,  apparently  semiconscious.  His  right  hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his  left  hand  he  tipped  a  goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore’s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore’s eyelids fluttered and opened. “Why,”  said  Snape,  without  preamble,  “why  did  you  put  on that  ring?  It  carries  a  curse,  surely  you  realized  that.  Why  even touch it?” Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it. Dumbledore grimaced. “I . . . was a fool. Sorely tempted . . .” “Tempted by what?” (cid:145) 680 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE Dumbledore did not answer. “It is a miracle you managed to return here!” Snape sounded fu-rious. “That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being —” Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio. “You  have  done  very  well,  Severus.  How  long  do  you  think  I have?” Dumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, “I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.” Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him. “I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.” “If  you  had  only  summoned  me  a  little  earlier,  I  might  have been able to do more, buy you more time!” said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. “Did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse?” “Something  like  that  .  .  .  I  was  delirious,  no  doubt.  .  .  .”  said Dumbledore.  With  an  effort  he  straightened  himself  in  his  chair. “Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.” Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled. “I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.” Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more  on  the  subject  of  Dumbledore’s  cursed  hand,  but  the  other (cid:145) 681 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling, Snape said, “The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius’s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco’s parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.” “In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,” said Dumbledore. “Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?” There was a short pause. “That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.” “Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?” “He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.” “And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students of Hogwarts?” Snape gave a stiff nod. “Good.  Now  then.  Your  first  priority  will  be  to  discover  what Draco  is  up  to.  A  frightened  teenage  boy  is  a  danger  to  others  as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you —” “— much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius’s position.” “All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for acciden-tal victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort’s wrath.” Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, “Are you intending to let him kill you?” “Certainly not. You must kill me.” (cid:145) 682 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone. “Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice heavy with  irony.  “Or  would  you  like  a  few  moments  to  compose  an epitaph?” “Oh,  not  quite  yet,”  said  Dumbledore,  smiling.  “I  daresay  the moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,”  he  indicated  his  withered  hand,  “we  can  be  sure  that  it will happen within a year.” “If  you  don’t  mind  dying,”  said  Snape  roughly,  “why  not  let Draco do it?” “That  boy’s  soul  is  not  yet  so  damaged,”  said  Dumbledore.  “I would not have it ripped apart on my account.” “And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?” “You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation,” said Dumbledore. “I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year’s league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is involved — I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it.” His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently  pierced  Harry,  as  though  the  soul  they  discussed  was visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod. Dumbledore seemed satisfied. “Thank you, Severus . . .” The  office  disappeared,  and  now  Snape  and  Dumbledore  were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight. (cid:145) 683 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE “What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are clos-eted together?” Snape asked abruptly. Dumbledore looked weary. “Why? You aren’t trying to give him more  detentions,  Severus? The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out.” “He is his father over again —” “In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother’s. I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.” “Information,” repeated Snape. “You trust him . . . you do not trust me.” “It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.” “And why may I not have the same information?” “I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.” “Which I do on your orders!” “And  you  do  it  extremely  well.  Do  not  think  that  I  underesti-mate  the  constant  danger  in  which  you  place  yourself,  Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding  the  essentials  is  a  job  I  would  entrust  to  nobody  but you.” “Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlu-mency, whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord’s mind!” “Voldemort  fears  that  connection,”  said  Dumbledore.  “Not  so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry’s mind (cid:145) 684 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.” “I don’t understand.” “Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry’s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame —” “Souls? We were talking of minds!” “In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the other.” Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them. “After you have killed me, Severus —” “You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small ser-vice  of  me!”  snarled  Snape,  and  real  anger  flared  in  the  thin  face now. “You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!” “You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?” Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed. “Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you. . . .” They were back in Dumbledore’s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes  sat  silent  as  Snape  sat  quite  still,  as  Dumbledore  walked around him, talking. “Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?” (cid:145) 685 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE “But what must he do?” “That  is  between  Harry  and  me.  Now  listen  closely,  Severus. There will come a time — after my death — do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.” “For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished. “Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops send-ing that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him un-der magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.” “Tell him what?” Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. “Tell  him  that  on  the  night  Lord  Voldemort  tried  to  kill  him, when  Lily  cast  her  own  life  between them  as  a  shield,  the  Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Volde-mort’s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building. Part of Lord Vol-demort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of  speech  with  snakes,  and  a  connection  with  Lord  Voldemort’s mind  that  he  has  never  understood.  And  while  that  fragment  of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.” Harry  seemed  to  be  watching  the  two  men  from  one  end  of  a long tunnel, they were so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears. “So the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly. “And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.” Another long silence. Then Snape said, “I thought . . . all these years . . . that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.”  (cid:145) 686 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE “We  have  protected  him  because  it  has  been  essential  to  teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. “Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth: Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.” Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified. “You  have  kept  him  alive  so  that  he  can  die  at  the  right  mo-ment?” “Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?” “Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He stood up. “You have used me.” “Meaning?” “I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal dan-ger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter —” “But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?” “For him?” shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronum!” From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. “After all this time?” “Always,” said Snape.  (cid:145) 687 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE And  the  scene  shifted.  Now,  Harry  saw  Snape  talking  to  the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk. “You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry’s de-parture from his aunt and uncle’s,” said Dumbledore. “Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry’s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly. . . . I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort’s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows. . . .” Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration. “You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,” Snape murmured, “that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It is the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?” “I understand,” murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused. . . . Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eat-ers, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George. . . . A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back — “Sectumsempra!” shouted Snape. But the spell, intended for the Death Eater’s wand hand, missed and hit George instead — And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius’s old bedroom. Tears were   (cid:145) 688 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  PRINCE’S  TALE dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words:  could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind’s going, personally! Lots of love,   Snape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers. . . . And now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into his portrait. “Headmaster!  They  are  camping  in  the  Forest  of  Dean!  The Mudblood —” “Do not use that word!” “—  the  Granger  girl,  then,  mentioned  the  place  as  she  opened her bag and I heard her!” “Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster’s chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor — and he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry’s mind and see you acting for him —” “I know,” said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dum-bledore and pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor.  (cid:145) 689 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE “And  you  still  aren’t  going  to  tell  me  why  it’s  so  important  to give  Potter  the  sword?”  said  Snape  as  he  swung  a  traveling  cloak over his robes. “No, I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore’s portrait. “He will know what to do with it. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley’s mishap —” Snape turned at the door. “Don’t worry, Dumbledore,” he said coolly. “I have a plan. . . .” And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room: Snape might just have closed the door. (cid:145) 690 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T H I R T Y - F O U R THE FOREST AGAIN     F inally,  the  truth.  Lying  with  his  face  pressed  into  the  dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learn-ing  the  secrets  of  victory,  Harry  understood  at  last  that  he  was not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death’s welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort’s remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across Voldemort’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither could survive. He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in  his  dread  of  death,  it  pumped  all  the  harder,  valiantly  keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats were num-bered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest? (cid:145) 691 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times he  had  thought  that  it  was  about  to  happen  and  escaped,  he  had never really thought of the thing itself: His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying. If he could only have died on that summer’s night when he had left  number  four,  Privet  Drive,  for  the  last  time,  when  the  noble phoenix-feather wand had saved him! If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! Or  if  he  could  have  launched  himself  in  front  of  a  wand  to  save someone he loved. . . . He envied even his parents’ deaths now. This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits on the walls were all empty. Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had he  never  appreciated  what  a  miracle  he  was,  brain  and  nerve  and bounding heart? It would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes. Dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized  that  now.  He  had  never  questioned  his  own  assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to (cid:145) 692 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FOREST  AGAIN him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds ty-ing not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort. And  Dumbledore  had  known  that  Harry  would  not  duck  out, that he would keep going to the end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn’t he? Dumble-dore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind’s eye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe: Death was impatient. . . . But  Dumbledore  had  overestimated  him.  He  had  failed:  The snake survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it. . . . Ron and Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course. . . . That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others . . . so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on. . . . Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. I must die. It must end. Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as though he had parted from them long ago. There would be  no  good-byes  and  no  explanations,  he  was  determined  of  that. This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked (cid:145) 693 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his sur-render had elapsed. He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird.  Perhaps  it  knew  it  had  little  time  left,  perhaps  it  was  deter-mined to fulfill a lifetime’s beats before the end. He did not look back as he closed the office door. The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed. Harry  pulled  the  Invisibility  Cloak  over  himself  and  descended through  the  floors,  at  last  walking  down  the  marble  staircase  into the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors easily. Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage,  must  have  sneaked  back  just  as  Malfoy,  Crabbe,  and Goyle had done. He was tiny in death. “You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,” said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman’s lift and carried him into the Great Hall. Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off down the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies. (cid:145) 694 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FOREST  AGAIN Harry  took  one  glance  back  at  the  entrance  of  the  Great  Hall. People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weas-leys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this. He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though  they  were  holding  their  breath,  waiting  to  see  whether  he could do what he must. Harry  moved  toward  Neville,  who  was  bending  over  another body. “Neville.” “Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!” Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure. “Where are you going, alone?” Neville asked suspiciously. “It’s all part of the plan,” said Harry. “There’s something I’ve got to do. Listen — Neville —” “Harry!”  Neville  looked  suddenly  scared.  “Harry,  you’re  not thinking of handing yourself over?” “No,” Harry lied easily. “ ’Course not . . . this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort’s snake, Neville? He’s got a huge snake. . . . Calls it Nagini . . .” “I’ve heard, yeah. . . . What about it?” “It’s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they —” The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, (cid:145) 695 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR made it impossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together again: This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take Harry’s place: There would still be three in the secret. “Just in case they’re — busy — and you get the chance —” “Kill the snake?” “Kill the snake,” Harry repeated. “All right, Harry. You’re okay, are you?” “I’m fine. Thanks, Neville.” But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on. “We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?” “Yeah, I —” The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could not go on. Neville did not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to look for more bodies. Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Some-one  else  was  moving  not  far  away,  stooping  over  another  prone figure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he realized it was Ginny. He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother. “It’s all right,” Ginny was saying. “It’s okay. We’re going to get you inside.” “But  I  want  to  go  home,”  whispered  the  girl.  “I  don’t  want  to fight anymore!”  (cid:145) 696 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FOREST  AGAIN “I know,” said Ginny, and her voice broke. “It’s going to be all right.” Ripples of cold undulated over Harry’s skin. He wanted to shout out to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home. . . . But he was home. Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known. He and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here. . . . Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With  a  huge  effort  Harry  forced  himself  on.  He  thought  he  saw Ginny  look  around  as  he  passed,  and  wondered  whether  she  had sensed someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back. Hagrid’s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert . . . He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped. A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through  it.  He  had  no  strength  left  for  a  Patronus.  He  could  no longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on  his  face,  was  so  precious:  To  think  that  people  had  years  and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging   (cid:145) 697 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. . . . The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out. I open at the close. Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible, it seemed to have sped up, and un-derstanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought. This was the close. This was the moment. He  pressed  the  golden  metal  to  his  lips  and  whispered,  “I  am about to die.” The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco’s wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, “Lumos.” The black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible. And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them: They were fetching him. He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times. He  knew  it  had  happened,  because  he  heard  slight  movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest. He opened his eyes and looked around. They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They   (cid:145) 698 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FOREST  AGAIN resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. Less sub-stantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him, and on each face, there was the same loving smile. James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley’s. Sirius  was  tall  and  handsome,  and  younger  by  far  than  Harry had seen him in life. He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face. Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker  and  darker.  He  looked  happy  to  be  back  in  this  familiar place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings. Lily’s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew close to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face  hungrily,  as  though  she  would  never  be  able  to  look  at  him enough. “You’ve been so brave.” He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever, and that would be enough. “You are nearly there,” said James. “Very close. We are . . . so “Does it hurt?” The childish question had fallen from Harry’s lips before he could proud of you.” stop it. “Dying? Not at all,” said Sirius. “Quicker and easier than falling asleep.”  (cid:145) 699 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR “And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,” said Lupin. “I didn’t want you to die,” Harry said. These words came without his volition. “Any of you. I’m sorry —” He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him. “— right after you’d had your son . . . Remus, I’m sorry —” “I am sorry too,” said Lupin. “Sorry I will never know him . . . but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.” A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the for-est lifted the hair at Harry’s brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision. “You’ll stay with me?” “Until the very end,” said James. “They won’t be able to see you?” asked Harry. “We are part of you,” said Sirius. “Invisible to anyone else.” Harry looked at his mother. “Stay close to me,” he said quietly. And he set off. The dementors’ chill did not overcome him; he  passed  through  it  with  his  companions,  and  they  acted  like Patronuses  to  him,  and  together  they  marched  through  the  old trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled  and  twisted  underfoot.  Harry  clutched  the  Cloak  tightly around  him  in  the  darkness,  traveling  deeper  and  deeper  into  the forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he  would  find  him.  Beside  him,  making  scarcely  a  sound,  walked James,  Sirius,  Lupin,  and  Lily,  and  their  presence  was  his  cour-age, and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other. His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs work-(cid:145) 700 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FOREST  AGAIN ing without conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort. . . . A thud and a whisper: Some other living creature had stirred close by. Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too. “Someone there,” came a rough whisper close at hand. “He’s got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it be — ?” Two  figures  emerged  from  behind  a  nearby  tree:  Their  wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov  peering  into  the  dark-ness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything. “Definitely  heard  something,”  said  Yaxley.  “Animal,  d’you reckon?” “That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,” said Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder. Yaxley looked down at his watch. “Time’s nearly up. Potter’s had his hour. He’s not coming.” “And he was sure he’d come! He won’t be happy.” “Better go back,” said Yaxley. “Find out what the plan is now.” He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded encouragement. They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and  Yaxley  and  Dolohov  stepped  out  into  a  clearing  that  Harry (cid:145) 701 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR knew  had  been  the  place  where  the  monstrous  Aragog  had  once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarm of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause. A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of  them  were  still  masked  and  hooded;  others  showed  their  faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shad-ows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated  and  terrified,  and  Narcissa,  whose  eyes  were  sunken  and full of apprehension. Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo. When  Dolohov  and  Yaxley  rejoined  the  circle,  Voldemort looked up. “No sign of him, my Lord,” said Dolohov. Voldemort’s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers. “My Lord —” Bellatrix  had  spoken:  She  sat  closest  to  Voldemort,  disheveled, her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed. (cid:145) 702 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FOREST  AGAIN Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but eyed him in worshipful fascination. “I  thought  he  would  come,”  said  Voldemort  in  his  high,  clear voice, his eyes on the leaping flames. “I expected him to come.” Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. His hands were sweating as he pulled  off  the  Invisibility  Cloak  and  stuffed  it  beneath  his  robes, with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to fight. “I was, it seems . . . mistaken,” said Voldemort. “You weren’t.” Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster: He did not want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers, and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mat-tered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them. The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even  laughter.  Voldemort  had  frozen  where  he  stood,  but  his  red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between them. Then a voice yelled: “HARRY! NO!” He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His  massive  body  shook  the  branches  overhead  as  he  struggled, desperate. “NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT’RE YEH — ?” “QUIET!” shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand Hagrid was silenced. (cid:145) 703 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Vol-demort to Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glitter-ing cage behind Voldemort’s head. Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no at-tempt to draw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, consid-ering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth. “Harry  Potter,”  he  said  very  softly.  His  voice  might  have  been part of the spitting fire. “The Boy Who Lived.” None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his — Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if he pro-ceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to hap-pen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear — He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and every-thing was gone. (cid:145) 704 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T H I R T Y - F I V E  KING’S CROSS   H e lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone.  Nobody  was  watching.  Nobody  else  was  there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself. A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too. Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total soli-tude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered  whether,  as  he  could  feel,  he  would  be  able  to  see.  In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes. He  lay  in  a  bright  mist,  though  it  was  not  like  mist  he  had ever  experienced  before.  His  surroundings  were  not  hidden  by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into sur-roundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither (cid:145) 705 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be. He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses anymore. Then  a  noise  reached  him  through  the  unformed  nothingness that  surrounded  him:  the  small  soft  thumpings  of  something  that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdrop-ping on something furtive, shameful. For the first time, he wished he were clothed. Barely  had  the  wish  formed  in  his  head  than  robes  appeared  a short distance away. He took them and pulled them on: They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared, just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . . He  stood  up,  looking  around.  Was  he  in  some  great  Room  of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Per-haps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping  and  whimpering  noises  coming  from  somewhere  close by in the mist. . . . Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean,  a  hall  larger  by  far  than  the  Great  Hall,  with  that  clear, domed  glass  ceiling.  It  was  quite  empty.  He  was  the  only  person there, except for — He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a   (cid:145) 706 (cid:145) \\x0cKING’S  CROSS seat  where  it  had  been  left,  unwanted,  stuffed  out  of  sight,  strug-gling for breath. He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a cow-ard. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him. “You cannot help.” He  spun  around.  Albus  Dumbledore  was  walking  toward  him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. “Harry.” He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. “You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.” Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet. . . “But you’re dead,” said Harry. “Oh yes,” said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. “Then . . . I’m dead too?” “Ah,” said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. “That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.” They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. “Not?” repeated Harry.  (cid:145) 707 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE “Not,” said Dumbledore. “But . . .” Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. “But I should have died — I didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!” “And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have made all the difference.” Happiness  seemed  to  radiate  from  Dumbledore  like  light,  like fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content. “Explain,” said Harry. “But  you  already  know,”  said  Dumbledore.  He  twiddled  his thumbs together. “I let him kill me,” said Harry. “Didn’t I?” “You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Go on!” “So the part of his soul that was in me . . .” Dumbledore  nodded  still  more  enthusiastically,  urging  Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face. “. . . has it gone?” “Oh yes!” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.” “But then . . .” Harry  glanced  over  his  shoulder  to  where  the  small,  maimed creature trembled under the chair. “What is that, Professor?” “Something  that  is  beyond  either  of  our  help,”  said  Dumble-dore. “But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?” “I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.” (cid:145) 708 (cid:145) \\x0cKING’S  CROSS Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, with-out effort. “He took my blood,” said Harry. “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protec-tion inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!” “I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?” He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the ago-nized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again. “Are you sure we can’t do anything?” “There is no help possible.” “Then explain . . . more,” said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. “You  were  the  seventh  Horcrux,  Harry,  the  Horcrux  he  never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. “And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which  Voldemort  does  not  value,  he  takes  no  trouble  to  compre-hend. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and in-nocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That (cid:145) 709 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. “He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.” Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. “And you knew this? You knew — all along?” “I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumble-dore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble. “There’s more,” said Harry. “There’s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?” “As to that, I cannot be sure.” “Have a guess, then,” said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. “What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Vol-demort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto un-known and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented,  and  no  wandmaker  could,  I  think,  ever  have  pre-dicted it or explained it to Voldemort. “Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrifice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. (cid:145) 710 (cid:145) \\x0cKING’S  CROSS “Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in  history,  Voldemort  proceeded  to  attack  you  with  a  wand  that shared  a  core  with  yours.  And  now  something  very  strange  hap-pened,  as  we  know.  The  cores  reacted  in  a  way  that  Lord  Volde-mort, who never knew that your wand was twin of his, had never expected. “He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had ac-cepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Vol-demort  has  never  been  able  to  do.  Your  courage  won,  your  wand overpowered  his.  And  in  doing  so,  something  happened  between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. “I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and quali-ties of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he  pursued  you,  recognized  a  man  who  was  both  kin  and  mortal enemy,  and  it  regurgitated  some  of  his  own  magic  against  him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?” “But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?” asked Harry. “My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Vol-demort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of  magic.  Only  toward  him  was  that  wand  abnormally  powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly. (cid:145) 711 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here. “He killed me with your wand.” “He  failed  to  kill  you  with  my  wand,”  Dumbledore  corrected Harry. “I think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course,” he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.” “I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?” “Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking around. “Where would you say that we are?” Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, how-ever, he found that he had an answer ready to give. “It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.” “King’s Cross station!” Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. “Good gracious, really?” “Well, where do you think we are?” asked Harry, a little defen-sively. “My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.” Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infu-riating. He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location. “The Deathly Hallows,” he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face. “Ah, yes,” he said. He even looked a little worried. “Well?” For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked   (cid:145) 712 (cid:145) \\x0cKING’S  CROSS less than an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. “Can you forgive me?” he said. “Can you forgive me for not trust-ing you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.” “What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled by Dumble-dore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes. “The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. “A desper-ate man’s dream!” “But they’re real!” “Real,  and  dangerous,  and  a  lure  for  fools,”  said  Dumbledore. “And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.” “What do I know?” Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes. “Master  of  death,  Harry,  master  of  Death!  Was  I  better,  ulti-mately, than Voldemort?” “Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of course — how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!” “True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. “Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.” “Not the way he did,” said Harry. After all his anger at Dumble-dore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. “Hallows, not Horcruxes.” “Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore, “not Horcruxes. Precisely.”  (cid:145) 713 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE There  was  a  pause.  The  creature  behind  them  whimpered,  but Harry no longer looked around. “Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked. Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. “It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly. “Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.” “So it’s true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers —” “— were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nod-ding.  “Oh  yes,  I  think  so.  Whether  they  met  Death  on  a  lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those power-ful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems to  me  the  sort  of  legend  that  might  have  sprung  up  around  such creations. “The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last liv-ing  descendant,  who  was  born,  as  Ignotus  was,  in  the  village  of Godric’s Hollow.” Dumbledore smiled at Harry. “Me?” “You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my posses-sion on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrong-doing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a (cid:145) 714 (cid:145) \\x0cKING’S  CROSS closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely  old,  perfect  in  every  respect  .  .  .  and  then  your  father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!” His tone was unbearably bitter. “The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,” Harry said quickly. “Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.” “True,” sighed Dumbledore. “True.” Harry  waited,  but  Dumbledore  did  not  speak,  so  he  prompted him. “So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?” “Oh yes,” said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced him-self to meet Harry’s eyes. “You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.” “But I don’t despise you —” “Then  you  should,”  said  Dumbledore.  He  drew  a  deep  breath. “You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did,  what  she  became.  You  know  how  my  poor  father  sought  re-venge,  and  paid  the  price,  died  in  Azkaban.  You  know  how  my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana. “I resented it, Harry.” Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry’s head, into the distance. “I  was  gifted,  I  was  brilliant.  I  wanted  to  escape.  I  wanted  to shine. I wanted glory. “Do not misunderstand me,” he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. “I loved them. I loved my parents, I  loved  my  brother  and  my  sister,  but  I  was  selfish,  Harry,  more (cid:145) 715 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE selfish  than  you,  who  are  a  remarkably  selfless  person,  could  pos-sibly imagine. “So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came. . . .” Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again. “Grindelwald.  You  cannot  imagine  how  his  ideas  caught  me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant.  Grindelwald  and  I,  the  glorious  young  leaders  of  the revolution. “Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words.  It  would  all  be  for  the  greater  good,  and  any  harm  done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. “And  at  the  heart  of  our  schemes,  the  Deathly  Hallows!  How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone — to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. “And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend (cid:145) 716 (cid:145) \\x0cKING’S  CROSS said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’ “Invincible  masters  of  death,  Grindelwald  and  Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. “And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the  form  of  my  rough,  unlettered,  and  infinitely  more  admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow. “The  argument  became  a  fight.  Grindelwald  lost  control.  That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother’s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.” Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control. “Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. “Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.” “But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrim-geour!” burst out Harry. (cid:145) 717 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE “Would I?” asked Dumbledore heavily. “I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. “I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher —” “You were the best —” “—  you  are  very  kind,  Harry.  But  while  I  busied  myself  with the  training  of  young  wizards,  Grindelwald  was  raising  an  army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him. “Oh,  not  death,”  said  Dumbledore,  in  answer  to  Harry’s  ques-tioning look. “Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond  all  things  the  knowledge  that  it  had  been  I  who  brought about  her  death,  not  merely  through  my  arrogance  and  stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. “I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I de-layed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. “Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.”  (cid:145) 718 (cid:145) \\x0cKING’S  CROSS Another  silence.  Harry  did  not  ask  whether  Dumbledore  had ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore. At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.” Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glitter-ing on the crooked nose. “They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Vol-demort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . .” “. . . or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes. After another short pause Harry said, “You tried to use the Res-urrection Stone.” Dumbledore nodded. “When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the aban-doned home of the Gaunts — the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons — I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and   (cid:145) 719 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry I was. . . . “I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned noth-ing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.” “Why?”  said  Harry.  “It  was  natural!  You  wanted  to  see  them again. What’s wrong with that?” “Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. “But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owner. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.” Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How could he remain angry with Dumbledore now? “Why did you have to make it so difficult?” Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous. “I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I  was  scared  that,  if  presented  outright  with  the  facts  about  those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that (cid:145) 720 (cid:145) \\x0cKING’S  CROSS he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.” “And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?” “I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any ex-cept the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.” “But you expected him to go after the wand?” “I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself  what  quality  it  was  in  you  that  had  made  your  wand  so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .” “If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?” “I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did not work as I intended, did it?” “No,” said Harry. “That bit didn’t work out.” The  creature  behind  them  jerked  and  moaned,  and  Harry  and Dumbledore  sat  without  talking  for  the  longest  time  yet.  The (cid:145) 721 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. “I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?” “That is up to you.” “I’ve got a choice?” “Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in King’s Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s say . . . board a train.” “And where would it take me?” “On,” said Dumbledore simply. Silence again. “Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.” “True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.” “But you want me to go back?” “I think,” said Dumbledore, “that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.” Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair. “Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are  maimed,  fewer  families  are  torn  apart.  If  that  seems  to  you  a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.” Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other’s faces. (cid:145) 722 (cid:145) \\x0cKING’S  CROSS “Tell  me  one  last  thing,”  said  Harry.  “Is  this  real?  Or  has  this been happening inside my head?” Dumbledore  beamed  at  him,  and  his  voice  sounded  loud  and strong in Harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. “Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?” (cid:145) 723 (cid:145) \\x0cC H A P T E R  T H I R T Y - S I X  THE FLAW IN THE PLAN    H e was lying facedown on the ground again. The smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses, which had been  knocked  sideways  by  the  fall,  cutting  into  his  temple.  Every inch of him ached, and the place where the Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping. He had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous mur-murs filled the air. “My Lord . . . my Lord . . .” It was Bellatrix’s voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes  because  he  could  feel  it  pressed  between  his  chest  and  the (cid:145) 724 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight. “My Lord . . .” “That will do,” said Voldemort’s voice. More footsteps: Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a millimeter. Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eat-ers  were  hurrying  away  from  him,  returning  to  the  crowd  lining the  clearing.  Bellatrix  alone  remained  behind,  kneeling  beside Voldemort. Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now returned. . . . “My Lord, let me —” “I do not require assistance,” said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. “The boy . . . Is he dead?” There was complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press him harder  into  the  ground,  and  he  was  terrified  a  finger  or  an  eyelid might twitch. “You,” said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain. “Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.” Harry  did  not  know  who  had  been  sent  to  verify.  He  could only lie there, with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be (cid:145) 725 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX examined,  but  at  the  same  time  noting,  small  comfort  though  it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan. . . . Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry’s face, pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath his shirt, down to his chest, and  felt  his  heart.  He  could  hear  the  woman’s  fast  breathing,  her long  hair  tickled  his  face.  He  knew  that  she  could  feel  the  steady pounding of life against his ribs. “Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?” The whisper was barely audible; her lips were an inch from his ear, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers. “Yes,” he breathed back. He  felt  the  hand  on  his  chest  contract;  her  nails  pierced  him. Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up. “He is dead!” Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort won. “You see?” screeched Voldemort over the tumult. “Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!” Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort’s victory. He was lifted into the (cid:145) 726 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air: His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter. “Now,”  said  Voldemort,  “we  go  to  the  castle,  and  show them what has become of their  hero. Who shall drag the body? No — Wait —” There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him. “You carry him,” Voldemort said. “He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses — put on the glasses — he must be recognizable —” Someone slammed Harry’s glasses back onto his face with deliber-ate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid’s arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by move-ment or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. “Move,” said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his  way  through  the  close-growing  trees,  back  through  the  forest. Branches caught at Harry’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth  lolling  open,  his  eyes  shut,  and  in  the  darkness,  while  the Death  Eaters  crowed  all  around  them,  and  while  Hagrid  sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter. . . . The  two  giants  crashed  along  behind  the  Death  Eaters;  Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so (cid:145) 727 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the  lightening  of  the  darkness  through  his  closed  eyelids,  that  the trees were beginning to thin. “BANE!” Hagrid’s  unexpected  bellow  nearly  forced  Harry’s  eyes  open. “Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn’ fight, yeh cowardly bunch o’ nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter’s — d-dead . . . ?” Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. “Stop.” Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Volde-mort’s command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they stood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the outer trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father’s stag kept guardian in his heart. Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Volde-mort himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magnified  so  that  it  swelled  through  the  grounds,  crashing  upon Harry’s eardrums. “Harry  Potter  is  dead.  He  was  killed  as  he  ran  away,  trying  to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. (cid:145) 728 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN “The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman, or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their fam-ily. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and  be  forgiven,  and  you  will  join  me  in  the  new  world  we  shall build together.” There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again. “Come,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front of them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness. . . . “Harry,” sobbed Hagrid. “Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . .” Harry  shut  his  eyes  tight  again.  He  knew  that  they  were  ap-proaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within. “Stop.” The  Death  Eaters  came  to  a  halt:  Harry  heard  them  spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school. He could see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light streamed  upon  him  from  the  entrance  hall.  He  waited.  Any  mo-ment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid’s arms. (cid:145) 729 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX “NO!” The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or  dreamed  that  Professor  McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall’s despair. He squinted again for a single sec-ond and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry’s death for themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini’s head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again. “No!” “No!” “Harry! HARRY!” Ron’s, Hermione’s, and Ginny’s voices were worse than McGona-gall’s; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors  took  up  the  cause,  screaming  and  yelling  abuse  at  the Death Eaters, until — “SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced upon them all. “It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!” Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. “You see?” said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and  forward  right  beside  the  place  where  he  lay.  “Harry  Potter  is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!” “He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defend-ers of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more. (cid:145) 730 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN “He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,” said Voldemort, and there was relish in his voice for the lie, “killed while trying to save himself —” But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and  charged  at  Voldemort:  Harry  saw  the  figure  hit  the  ground, Disarmed,  Voldemort  throwing  the  challenger’s  wand  aside  and laughing. “And who is this?” he said in his soft snake’s hiss. “Who has vol-unteered  to  demonstrate  what  happens  to  those  who  continue  to fight when the battle is lost?” Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. “It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?” “Ah, yes, I remember,” said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who  was  struggling  back  to  his  feet,  unarmed  and  unprotected, standing in the no-man’s-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. “But you are a pureblood, aren’t you, my brave boy?” Volde-mort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled in fists. “So what if I am?” said Neville loudly. “You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.” “I’ll  join  you  when  hell  freezes  over,”  said  Neville.  “Dumble-dore’s Army!” he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort’s Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold. (cid:145) 731 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX “Very  well,”  said  Voldemort,  and  Harry  heard  more  danger  in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. “If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,” he said quietly, “be it.” Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle’s shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort’s hand. He shook the mildewed ob-ject by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the Sort-ing Hat. “There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” said Vol-demort. “There will be no more Houses. The emblem, shield, and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for every-one. Won’t they, Neville Longbottom?” He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto Neville’s head, so that it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay. “Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to any-one foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” said Voldemort, and with  a  flick  of  his  wand,  he  caused  the  Sorting  Hat  to  burst  into flames. Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act — And then many things happened at the same moment. They  heard  uproar  from  the  distant  boundary  of  the  school  as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries. (cid:145) 732 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN At  the  same  time,  Grawp  came  lumbering  around  the  side  of  the castle and yelled, “HAGGER!” His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort’s giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants, making the  earth  quake.  Then  came  hooves  and  the  twangs  of  bows,  and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks,  shouting  their  surprise.  Harry  pulled  the  Invisibility  Cloak from inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too. In one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle — The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a single  stroke  Neville  sliced  off  the  great  snake’s  head,  which  spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall,  and  Voldemort’s  mouth  was  open  in  a  scream  of  fury  that nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet — Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between  Neville  and  Voldemort  before  the  latter  could  raise  his wand.  Then,  over  the  screams  and  the  roars  and  the  thunderous stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid’s yell came loudest of all. “HARRY!” Hagrid shouted. “HARRY — WHERE’S HARRY?” Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters,  everyone  was  fleeing  the  giants’  stamping  feet,  and  nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort’s giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff (cid:145) 733 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them; and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike, were  being  forced  back  into  the  castle.  Harry  was  shooting  jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd. Still  hidden  beneath  the  Invisibility  Cloak,  Harry  was  buffeted into  the  entrance  hall:  He  was  searching  for  Voldemort  and  saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the  Great  Hall,  still  screaming  instructions  to  his  followers  as  he sent  curses  flying  left  and  right;  Harry  cast  more  Shield  Charms, and Voldemort’s would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it. And  now  there  were  more,  even  more  people  storming  up  the front  steps,  and  Harry  saw  Charlie  Weasley  overtaking  Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of  hooves,  as  behind  Harry  the  door  that  led  to  the  kitchens  was blasted off its hinges. The  house-elves  of  Hogwarts  swarmed  into  the  entrance  hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the  locket  of  Regulus  Black  bouncing  on  his  chest,  was  Kreacher, his bullfrog’s voice audible even above this din: “Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!” (cid:145) 734 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters,  their  tiny  faces  alive  with  malice,  and  everywhere  Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome  by  spells,  dragging  arrows  from  wounds,  stabbed  in  the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde. But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past strug-gling prisoners, and into the Great Hall. Voldemort  was  in  the  center  of  the  battle,  and  he  was  striking and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought  his  way  nearer,  still  invisible,  and  the  Great  Hall  became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jor-dan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall op-posite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing  down  Fenrir  Greyback,  Aberforth  Stunning  Rookwood, Arthur  and  Percy  flooring  Thicknesse,  and  Lucius  and  Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kings-ley all at once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him — Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny, and Luna,  all  battling  their  hardest,  but  Bellatrix  was  equal  to  them, and Harry’s attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch — (cid:145) 735 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways. “NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!” Mrs.  Weasley  threw  off  her  cloak  as  she  ran,  freeing  her  arms. Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger. “OUT OF MY WAY!” shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley’s wand slashed and twirled, and Bellatrix Lestrange’s smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew  from  both  wands,  the  floor  around  the  witches’  feet  became hot and cracked; both women were fighting to kill. “No!” Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. “Get back! Get back! She is mine!” Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood,  invisible,  torn  between  both,  wanting  to  attack  and  yet  to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. “What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” taunted Bellatrix,  as  mad  as  her  master,  capering as Molly’s curses danced around her. “When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?” “You — will — never — touch — our — children — again!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. Bellatrix  laughed,  the  same  exhilarated  laugh  her  cousin  Sirius had  given  as  he  toppled  backward  through  the  veil,  and  suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. Molly’s curse soared beneath Bellatrix’s outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart. Bellatrix’s  gloating  smile  froze,  her  eyes  seemed  to  bulge:  For (cid:145) 736 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she  toppled,  and  the  watching  crowd  roared,  and  Voldemort screamed. Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGona-gall, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writh-ing through the air, as Voldemort’s fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley. “Protego!” roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of “Harry!” “HE’S ALIVE!” were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and si-lence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other. “I don’t want anyone else to try to help,” Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. “It’s got to be like this. It’s got to be me.” Voldemort hissed. “Potter doesn’t mean that,” he said, his red eyes wide. “That isn’t how  he  works,  is  it?  Who  are  you  going  to  use  as  a  shield  today, Potter?” “Nobody,” said Harry simply. “There are no more Horcruxes. It’s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . .” “One of us?” jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. “You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and be-cause Dumbledore was pulling the strings?” (cid:145) 737 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX “Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort’s. “Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn’t defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?” “Accidents!” screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. “Accident and chance  and  the  fact  that  you  crouched  and  sniveled  behind  the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!” “You  won’t  be  killing  anyone  else  tonight,”  said  Harry  as  they circled, and stared into each other’s eyes, green into red. “You won’t be able to kill any of them ever again. Don’t you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people —” “But you did not!” “— I meant to, and that’s what did it. I’ve done what my mother did. They’re protected from you. Haven’t you noticed how none of the  spells  you  put  on  them  are  binding?  You  can’t  torture  them. You can’t touch them. You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?” “You dare —” “Yes, I dare,” said Harry. “I know things you don’t know, Tom Riddle.  I  know  lots  of  important  things  that  you  don’t.  Want  to hear some, before you make another big mistake?” Voldemort  did  not  speak,  but  prowled  in  a  circle,  and  Harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized and at bay, held   (cid:145) 738 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN back  by  the  faintest  possibility  that  Harry  might  indeed  know  a final secret. . . . “Is it love again?” said Voldemort, his snake’s face jeering. “Dum-bledore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your  Mudblood  mother  like  a  cockroach,  Potter  —  and  nobody seems  to  love  you  enough  to  run  forward  this  time  and  take  my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?” “Just  one  thing,”  said  Harry,  and  still  they  circled  each  other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret. “If it is not love that will save you this time,” said Voldemort, “you must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?” “I  believe  both,”  said  Harry,  and  he  saw  shock  flit  across  the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to  laugh,  and  the  sound  was  more  frightening  than  his  screams; humorless and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. “You think you know more magic than I do?” he said. “Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?” “Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.” “You  mean  he  was  weak!”  screamed  Voldemort.  “Too  weak  to dare,  too  weak  to  take  what  might  have  been  his,  what  will  be mine!” “No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a better man.”  (cid:145) 739 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX “I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!” “You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were wrong.” For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one. “Dumbledore  is  dead!”  Voldemort  hurled  the  words  at  Harry  as though they would cause him unendurable pain. “His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Pot-ter, and he will not return!” “Yes,  Dumbledore’s  dead,”  said  Harry  calmly,  “but  you  didn’t have him killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.” “What childish dream is this?” said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry’s. “Severus Snape wasn’t yours,” said Harry. “Snape was Dumble-dore’s, Dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my  mother.  And  you  never  realized  it,  because  of  the  thing  you can’t  understand.  You  never  saw  Snape  cast  a  Patronus,  did  you, Riddle?” Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart. “Snape’s Patronus was a doe,” said Harry, “the same as my moth-er’s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized,” he said as he saw Vol-demort’s nostrils flare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he?” “He  desired  her,  that  was  all,”  sneered  Voldemort,  “but  when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him —”  (cid:145) 740 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN “Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was Dumble-dore’s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been work-ing  against  you  ever  since!  Dumbledore  was  already  dying  when Snape finished him!” “It  matters  not!”  shrieked  Voldemort,  who  had  followed  every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. “It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty  obstacles  they  tried  to  put  in  my  path!  I  crushed  them  as  I crushed  your  mother,  Snape’s  supposed  great  love!  Oh,  but  it  all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! “Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy — I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!” “Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You’re right. But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .” “What is this?” Of  all  the  things  that  Harry  had  said  to  him,  beyond  any  rev-elation  or  taunt,  nothing  had  shocked  Voldemort  like  this.  Harry saw  his  pupils  contract  to  thin  slits,  saw  the  skin  around  his  eyes whiten. “It’s your one last chance,” said Harry, “it’s all you’ve got left. . . . I’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .”  (cid:145) 741 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX “You dare — ?” said Voldemort again. “Yes, I dare,” said Harry, “because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.” Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped  Draco’s  very  tightly.  The  moment,  he  knew,  was  seconds away. “That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you mur-dered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.” “He killed —” “Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death  was  planned  between  them!  Dumbledore  intended  to  die undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!” “But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!” Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. “I stole the wand from  its  last  master’s  tomb!  I  removed  it  against  its  last  master’s wishes! Its power is mine!” “You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough!  Holding  it,  using  it,  doesn’t  make  it  really  yours.  Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard. . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance. . . .” Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face. (cid:145) 742 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN “The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.” Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone. “But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy. . . .” “But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I got  there  first.  I  overpowered  Draco  weeks  ago.  I  took  this  wand from him.” Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of ev-eryone in the Hall upon it. “So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.” A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the near-est window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand: “Avada Kedavra!” “Expelliarmus!” The  bang  was  like  a  cannon  blast,  and  the  golden  flames  that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading,  marked  the  point  where  the  spells  collided.  Harry  saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master (cid:145) 743 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell. One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment sus-pended:  and  then  the  tumult  broke  around  Harry  as  the  screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all  the  Weasleys  and  Hagrid,  and  Kingsley  and  McGonagall  and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last — The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings  of  jubilation  and  mourning,  of  grief  and  celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as (cid:145) 744 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. . . . They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and  fifty  others  who  had  died  fighting  him.  McGonagall  had  re-placed the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House anymore:  All  were  jumbled  together,  teachers  and  pupils,  ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted  and  drained,  Harry  found  himself  sitting  on  a  bench beside Luna. “I’d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,” she said. “I’d love some,” he replied. “I’ll distract them all,” she said. “Use your Cloak.” And before he  could  say a word she had cried, “Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!” and pointed out of the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over him-self, and got to his feet. Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her  mother’s  shoulder:  There  would  be  time  to  talk  later,  hours and  days  and  maybe  years  in  which  to  talk.  He  saw  Neville,  the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as (cid:145) 745 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody  was  paying  them  any  attention.  Everywhere  he  looked  he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most. “It’s  me,”  he  muttered,  crouching  down  between  them.  “Will you come with me?” They  stood  up  at  once,  and  together  he,  Ron,  and  Hermione left  the  Great  Hall.  Great  chunks  were  missing  from  the  marble staircase,  part  of  the  balustrade  gone,  and  rubble  and  bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed. Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition:  We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one, And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun!  “Really  gives  a  feeling  for  the  scope  and  tragedy  of  the  thing, doesn’t it?” said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermi-one through. Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination. (cid:145) 746 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore. “Can we go up?” he asked the gargoyle. “Feel free,” groaned the statue. They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved  slowly  upward  like  an  escalator.  Harry  pushed  open  the door at the top. He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he  had  left  it,  and  then  an  earsplitting  noise  made  him  cry  out, thinking  of  curses  and  returning  Death  Eaters  and  the  rebirth  of Voldemort — But it was applause. All around  the  walls,  the  headmasters  and headmistresses  of  Hogwarts  were  giving  him  a  standing  ovation; they  waved  their  hats  and  in  some  cases  their  wigs,  they  reached through their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, “And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!” But  Harry  had  eyes  only  for  the  man  who  stood  in  the  largest portrait  directly  behind  the  headmaster’s  chair.  Tears  were  sliding down  from  behind  the  half-moon  spectacles  into  the  long  silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry with the same balm as phoenix song. At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him (cid:145) 747 (cid:145) \\x0cCHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them  with  enormous  care.  Exhausted  and  bleary-eyed  though  he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. “The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he began, “I dropped it in the forest. I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?” “My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. “A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?” “No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction. “I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed. “But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!” “And then there’s this.” Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. “I don’t want it,” said Harry. “What?” said Ron loudly. “Are you mental?” “I  know  it’s  powerful,”  said  Harry  wearily.  “But  I  was  happier with mine. So . . .” He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be re-paired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would. He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said, “Reparo.” (cid:145) 748 (cid:145) \\x0cTHE  FLAW  IN THE  PLAN As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion. “I’m  putting  the  Elder  Wand,”  he  told  Dumbledore,  who  was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, “back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it.” Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other. “Are you sure?” said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand. “I think Harry’s right,” said Hermione quietly. “That  wand’s  more  trouble  than  it’s  worth,”  said  Harry.  “And quite honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, think-ing now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryf-findor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, “I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.” (cid:145) 749 (cid:145) \\x0c  \\x0c                     NINTEEN YEARS LATER    \\x0c   \\x0cE P I L O G U E  NINETEEN YEARS LATER    A utumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and  as  the  little  family  bobbed  across  the  rumbling  road  toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs  in the cold air. Two large cages rattled  on  top  of  the  laden  trolleys  the  parents  were  pushing;  the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father’s arm. “It won’t be long, and you’ll be going too,” Harry told her. “Two years,” sniffed Lily. “I want to go now!” The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus’s voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. “I won’t! I won’t be in Slytherin!” “James, give it a rest!” said Ginny. (cid:145) 753 (cid:145) \\x0cEPILOGUE “I  only  said  he  might  be,”  said  James,  grinning  at  his  younger brother.  “There’s  nothing  wrong  with  that.  He  might  be  in Slyth —” But James caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. “You’ll write to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his parents immedi-ately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. “Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny. “Not every day,” said Albus quickly. “James says most people only get letters from home about once a month.” “We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny. “And  you  don’t  want  to  believe  everything  he  tells  you  about Hogwarts,” Harry put in. “He likes a laugh, your brother.” Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came.  Instead,  the  family  emerged  onto  platform  nine  and  three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared. “Where  are  they?”  asked  Albus  anxiously,  peering  at  the  hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform. “We’ll find them,” said Ginny reassuringly. But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out any-body’s faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnatu-rally  loud.  Harry  thought  he  heard  Percy  discoursing  loudly  on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . . (cid:145) 754 (cid:145) \\x0cNINETEEN  YEARS  LATER “I think that’s them, Al,” said Ginny suddenly. A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them. “Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. Rose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. “Parked  all  right,  then?”  Ron  asked  Harry.  “I  did.  Hermione didn’t  believe  I  could  pass  a  Muggle  driving  test,  did  you?  She thought I’d have to Confund the examiner.” “No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.” “As  a  matter  of  fact,  I  did  Confund  him,”  Ron  whispered  to Harry, as together they lifted Albus’s trunk and owl onto the train. “I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.” Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose’s younger brother,  having  an  animated  discussion  about  which  House  they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts. “If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said Ron, “but no pressure.” “Ron!” Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. “He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry’s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist. “Look who it is.” Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat  buttoned  up  to  his  throat.  His  hair  was  receding  somewhat, (cid:145) 755 (cid:145) \\x0cEPILOGUE which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as  much  as  Albus  resembled  Harry.  Draco  caught  sight  of  Harry, Ron,  Hermione,  and  Ginny  staring  at  him,  nodded  curtly,  and turned away again. “So that’s little Scorpius,” said Ron under his breath. “Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother’s brains.” “Ron, for heaven’s sake,” said Hermione, half stern, half amused. “Don’t  try  to  turn  them  against  each  other  before  they’ve  even started school!” “You’re  right,  sorry,”  said  Ron,  but  unable  to  help  himself,  he added, “Don’t get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.” “Hey!” James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news. “Teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder  into  the  billowing  clouds  of  steam.  “Just  seen  him!  And guess what he’s doing? Snogging Victoire!” He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. “Our  Teddy!  Teddy  Lupin!  Snogging  our  Victoire!  Our  cousin! And I asked Teddy what he was doing —” “You interrupted them?” said Ginny. “You are so like Ron —” “— and he said he’d come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He’s snogging her!” James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. “Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!” whispered Lily ec-statically. “Teddy would really be part of the family then!” (cid:145) 756 (cid:145) \\x0cNINETEEN  YEARS  LATER “He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said Harry. “Why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?” “Yeah!”  said  James  enthusiastically.  “I  don’t  mind  sharing  with Al — Teddy could have my room!” “No,” said Harry firmly, “you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished.” He  checked  the  battered  old  watch  that  had  once  been  Fabian Prewett’s. “It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.” “Don’t forget to give Neville our love!” Ginny told James as she hugged him. “Mum! I can’t give a professor love!” “But you know Neville —” James rolled his eyes. “Outside, yeah, but at school he’s Professor Longbottom, isn’t he? I can’t walk into Herbology and give him love. . . .” Shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feel-ings by aiming a kick at Albus. “See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.” “I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!” But  James  merely  laughed,  permitted  his  mother  to  kiss  him, gave  his  father  a  fleeting  hug,  then  leapt  onto  the  rapidly  filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends. “Thestrals  are  nothing  to  worry  about,”  Harry  told  Albus. “They’re gentle things, there’s nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages, you’ll be going in the boats.” (cid:145) 757 (cid:145) \\x0cEPILOGUE Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. “See you at Christmas.” “Bye,  Al,”  said  Harry  as  his  son  hugged  him.  “Don’t  forget Hagrid’s  invited  you  to  tea  next  Friday.  Don’t  mess  with  Peeves. Don’t duel anyone till you’ve learned how. And don’t let James wind you up.” “What if I’m in Slytherin?” The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the  moment  of  departure  could  have  forced  Albus  to  reveal  how great and sincere that fear was. Harry crouched down so that Albus’s face was slightly above his own.  Alone  of  Harry’s  three  children,  Albus  had  inherited  Lily’s eyes. “Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, “you were named for two headmas-ters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.” “But just say —” “— then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won’t it? It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.” “Really?” “It did for me,” said Harry. He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus’s face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of par-ents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders. (cid:145) 758 (cid:145) \\x0cNINETEEN  YEARS  LATER Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number  of  faces,  both  on  the  train  and  off,  seemed  to  be  turned toward Harry. “Why  are  they  all  staring?”  demanded  Albus  as  he  and  Rose craned around to look at the other students. “Don’t  let  it  worry  you,”  said  Ron.  “It’s  me.  I’m  extremely famous.” Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and  Harry  walked  alongside  it,  watching  his  son’s  thin  face,  al-ready ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. . . . The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry’s hand was still raised in farewell. “He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny. As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead. “I know he will.” The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.
